# Sentiment_analysis

The aim of this project is to try several different language models and sentiment analysis libraries in order to compare which one is going to have the most accurate results. 

I collected reviews data from TripAdvisor website - the written reviews as well as numerical scores left by people visiting certain places. By comparing written results with numerical scores I can measure the "accuracy" of the language model. I am also curious to check which European city will have the most positive sentiment based on reviews. I will also compare the written review with the numerical scores - whether they are always adequate or not neccesarily.
