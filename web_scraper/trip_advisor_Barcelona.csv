0,The overwhelming presence of Gaudi in Barcelona.,A little way out of central Barcelona and having walked to it last time we visiting this time we decided to make things a little easier by getting a taxi! The last time we were here the park was open to all but this time tickets were needed and it was a good job we booked them online first. The gingerbread houses and the mosaic balcony are just bonkers.,

14,Must see,A fascinating deep dive into civil war politics and history brought alive through fascinating individual stories. Taking the time to hear this history (we knew very little) has really enhanced our subsequent time in Spain. You won’t cover a lot of ground in terms of walking distance but you definitely do in terms of information !,

16,Bad experience,"We arrived in Barcelona at the port, the tour van and our guide Marco were timely and efficient. After rounding up all members taking the tour, Marco explained our itinerary and off we went. The tour was half the day and a great over view of the city and its highlights! Marco was knowledgeable and engaging, he explained the history and details all of the sites as we passed by or when we stopped at the several locations. Walking Guell park and having the details about it was fantastic! At the end of the tour they dropped us off at our hotel with our luggage. I highly recommend taking this tour when you arrive in Barcelona.",
17,Explosion of colours!,"Thank you for your feedback. We sincerely appreciate it! Marco is one of our best guides.

18,This is an amazing work of art and functioning cathedral.,"Myself and my wife were in Barcelona from NY (USA) and decided to take a tour to Monserrat. I can not say how amazing our tour was because words would not explain how perfect the tour was. Chris was our guide, he was better than I ever could have wanted.

He explained so much about the history, not to mention his energy, knowledge & love of the city too. He gave us options, took a few pics for us, explained so much for the rest of our stay in Barcelona as well. This tour made our entire trip. Highlight of our stay in Spain.

Here's a list of things to consider:
-Professional and Safe
-Really nice car!
-Knowledge of the ins and out of not only our tour but helped us learn about things to do in Barcelona too

Let's put it this way, we talked more about the tour and guide then we did about some of the places we went too! Thanks Chris! Pasquale & Donna! Ciao!",
19,An experience you will remember!,Thank you very much! You are very kind to have taken the time to write about us and we highly appreciate it.

22,Amazing,Hello! Sorry for the late reply: it looks like somehow we stopped getting review notifications and we had been missing lots of them! Catching up now! Thank you so much for your review!

I hope to see you again when you are back to Barcelona to see the new towers in Sagrada Familia that will be coming up in the next years!,
23,A Sunday to Remember,"We enjoyed our full day excursion with Marta as our friendly and knowledgeable guide immensely. We were picked up at our hotel at the scheduled time and dropped off at the designated site for the start of the tour on a comfortable small van that accommodated 12 people. The sunny day was perfect for our first stop in Montserrat where we took in breathtaking views before heading to the impressive Guell Park, on to hear more history about Gaudi and see our final stop at the Sangre Familia. A wonderful was to get an overview of Barcelona’s finest sites!",

29,Well worth the visit…,"As a group of 6 we booked this as a pickup from the cruise ship. They stored our luggage and the dropped us off at our Barcelona hotel when tour finished. Antonio was our guide driving us to Monserrat and providing information about sites along the way. When we reached Monserrat he had a map and explained where to go and what to see. Normally he would park the van and come back and tour with us but we were more committed with him staying with the van and our luggage. They had arranged tickets to see the church and the boys choir. Drove us back to our hotel on time, even getting special access to the normally pedestrian only streets. Great tour, guide and overall services. Would highly recommend.",

40,A bus trip is recommended,"We had the most amazing experience with Spain Day Tours. We were doing a small two day trip for 13 people prior to going on a cruise. Originally we booked Spain Day Tours simply for our private 4 hour tour of Barcelona but then also ended up using them for transfers as well.

The number one thing I'll say is that they are so professional, organized, quick to respond, and very good about sending detailed itineraries and reminders to make you feel certain you are in good hands. Especially as people travelling abroad we felt so comfortable. They arranged two separate hotel pick ups for our groups to different Airbnbs as well as cruise drop off and cruise pick up to airport at the end. The drivers were waiting for us exactly where we were told they would be. The transfers were large and clean and the drivers were friendly and helpful.

Our 4 hour private tour was amazing. We opted to go inside Park Guell and just see Sagradia Familia from the outside. ""Charles"" our driver was so wonderful and enthusiastic, teaching us so much along the way. We saw so many of the sights and even though we only had one full day in Barcelona we felt we saw it all! It was an amazing introduction. Our guide had a good sense of humor, was patient with our needs (and small children) and was always willing to answer a question or take a photo. It was a wonderful experience and the van was perfect sized for our group of 13.

I honestly could not recommend them enough. I book lots of travel for myself and others and will be using them again in the future.",

46,Disappointed,"We had the BEST tour guide ever! We wanted to see and experience as much of Barcelona as possible in a 1/2 day private tour and were impressed by the previous Yelp reviews posted for Barcelona Day Tours. With only a day’s notice, by communicating via email, we were abLa Sagrada schedule a tour to our liking after speaking to “Jay”. Our driver/tour guide, “Fabio”, was the absolute best! He picked us up at our hotel in a nice, clean, and very comfortable Mercedes minivan. Fabio took us to many of Barcelona’s highlights with exception to La Sagrada Familia & Basilica Del Sagrado Corazon Tibidabo as we had already visited those two churches in previous days while in Barcelona.

Fabio took us to see the following within our 4-hour tour: • Park Guell • Passeig de Gracia • La Pedrera/Casa Mila • Casa Batllo • Casa Amataller • Casa Morera • Plaza España • The National Palace • The Olympic Ring • Montjuic • The Columbus Monument • Port Olympic • Plaza Cataluña • Bunkers Del Carmel

Fabio was very friendly, personable, and accommodating to our requests. He was able to fit our minivan into many tight streets which we never thought he’d be able to navigate through showing us the insights of the old streets of Barcelona near the walls of the city. We got to see & experience what would be part of a walking tour without actually “walking”. We loved every bit of our guided tour experience, and maybe would’ve liked to have gotten to ride their suspended skyline from the beaches to the mountains & driven by the Arch de Triumph, but that was no fault of our guide. Our party overly extended many of our independent stops which only shortened our number of sightseeing stops, unless we wanted to add time to our tour. We couldn’t praise Fabio enough! We would recommend him highly, and suggest anyone looking to book a tour request him by name when emailing to book a tour. If we could give Fabio a 6-star review, he’d be definitely deserving of one!!!",

76,Amazing Experience!,"We had a wonderful time exploring Barcelona with our guide Ariana. Experiencing Barcelona food culture and history was an excellent way to gain appreciation for this great city. Ariana was knowledgeable and fun to be with. We’re going to circle back to enjoy more food and drink from the vendors she introduced us to. Shopping at the local food markets is not to be missed. We purchased spices this morning after having breakfast of spinach pie, espresso and tomato bread. Yum.",

98,A MUST DO IN BARCELONA,"This was the last of our tours on a 16-day vacation, and the last of 5 tours in Barcelona alone, so by the time we met up with our group of 8 and our guide Eric, an American who was able provide some insight as an expat, I knew some of the info might be a repeat, but I actually liked getting so many slightly different takes on a really interesting city. I’ve been on many (50+) food tours, so I appreciate when there’s an added element of history. Usually, I like to take food tours at the beginning of a visit, which we also did, but they also make great final dinners, so that is what I booked this tour for. I’ve been on a Devour tour before and I had great experience with their customer support, so I was happy to see their offerings in Barcelona. Sometimes, they’re a bit more expensive, but I have generally found it worth the difference.

I will note that the first stop was the same as the first stop on our other Barcelona food tour, and some of the items we had were the same, but some were different, so I didn’t mind the repeat. I was extremely impressed by the care they took with one of the guests with celiacs (even though the website says they can accommodate gluten-free guests but not celiacs); they were very careful at every stop and provided nice substitutions. The next stop was one that no other food tours go to; it felt very authentically local and the snacks were delicious. I do wish I had been brave enough to try drinking wine from the carafe, and I felt that it went to waste because so many of us were too chicken to try. I appreciated that there were alcoholic beverages at every stop, a place to sit even in crowded places, and plenty of walking and history in between. Our final stop was essentially a full meal with a starter, entrée, and dessert. I will say though that sitting around a small table on the second floor was rather hot. I understand that that’s probably the best place to seat a food tour, but it was almost uncomfortable.

The Devour website description of this tour is very accurate, which I appreciate. Looking at it now, they absolutely delivered. And even though a lot of the history recounted was familiar after going on multiple tours in 48 hours that covered a lot of the same ground, there were still tidbits and takes that were a little different. I did feel a little like I was in school at the end though we were asked for feedback on the spot, although I recognize the care that Devour puts into their tours and stop selections, so I can see how this immediate feedback is helpful for the guide, if perhaps, a bit filtered. Even now though, behind the safety of my keyboard, I can say that this was an excellent food tour, a great finale for our Barcelona visit, and that I would certainly select Devour in the future.",

As we walked through Barcelona, Vera absolutely made us learn to appreciate the history of the food and the place much better than reading about it or just experiencing it. And the food and drink were delicious. She even accommodated my aversion to lactose.
Her unique background of being a US college grad, plus her local connection to Barcelona having lived and worked there for awhile added to the flavor of her perspective.
The tour and the evening was very enjoyable specially with the group we had. It definitely made Barcelona trip much more memorable.",

Ariana was able to keep it interesting and we loved each stop. We learned about the origins of the foods and how it related to the gothic quarter.

113,Wanted To Love It,This tour was simply amazing. Our tour guide Valentina was the best. She was very knowledgeable on the history of the area and made it easy to understand. The historical areas she brought us to in the Gothic Quarter I would not have found myself because that place is a maze. The bars and restaurants visited were very unique. The food and drinks were excellent. I can now say that I have a good understanding of local drinks and tapas that this area is known for. I would definitely recommend this tour to friends and family.,

And a fun wander through historic Barcelona starting in our favourite market (no, not the tourist trap market on Ramblas) - lots to eat, lots to drink. almost 4 hours - and a great pleasure .

146,"A ""Trip Maker"" - Emotionally moved.","I wanted to love this tour, but unfortunately I didn’t. Our guide was very enthusiastic and knowledgeable and I did enjoy the historical aspect of the tour. The Gothic quarter is amazing and it’s incredible that Valentina could navigate her way around the maze-like streets and not get lost. I would love to redo that part of the tour. As a relatively recent fan of James Blick’s (discovered him within the past year in search of videos about food in Spain) I was familiar with the bodegas/tavernas we ended up visiting on our tour. These places are tiny and taking a group of 8 American tourists into these places felt awkward to me. There was something a bit rushed in the way the food was brought out and I didn’t feel like the staff was very happy to see us. But to be clear I never felt that the guide was rushing us. She was making sure we all had wine and were enjoying our food. James is all about eating like a local and I think his goal is to make you feel like you can go into any joint and feel like you can navigate a menu and pick good options. I felt like with the tour we were crashing a party and the hosts kind of couldn’t wait to see us go. It goes without saying that this was just my personal opinion. I would like to add that I did a similar Devour tour in Sevilla and had a very different experience. Maybe it was due to
it being a different city or possibly the choice of restaurants but I had a much more positive response.",

149,Don't miss this unforgettable history tour,"I had a wonderful tour - Barcelona at Sunset: Tapas and Wine - with Ariana C on May 2. Ariana was a terrific guide for our small group. This was different than most food tours - instead of quick bites at 6 or so places, we visited three spots, and had some wine and 3 or 4 items at each. I enjoyed the more leisurely pace for an early dinner. All the food choices were excellent. I've done Devour several times before in other cities, and they're always great.

For this trip, though, two suggestions:
-- Better communication. I booked a few weeks prior to the tour, and had NO communication after I got the receipt. Usually, there would be a confirmation by email a couple days before, and a text the morning of a tour. That was serious miss this time.
-- Meeting Point. The little park where we met was right across from the first stop, but in a no-car zone, so all my taxi could do was get close, and point. If I hadn't had GPS working on my phone, I would have been lost. Definitely choose a better meeting point, so I can give the taxi the address, and it's not hard to find.

But again, the tour was awesome, and I'll definitely look for Devour options when I'm back in Europe.",

I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this tour even if you only have a limited time in Spain!",
172,Compulsory for anyone interested in Civil War history,"This was a really great trip. Very professionally run, with a lot of focus on safety. Once everyone was up to speed with riding a Segway, our guide (Oriol) took us on a tour around the park and port area. Very interesting information, with lots of time to stop for photos. Oriol speaks excellent English and had a lot of information about the history behind the sites. A lovely morning trip.",
173,Spanish Civil War in Barcelona- OUTSTANDING,"We had Anna as our guide, we were in a group of 4 people so it was nice for us to learn more about this beautiful city.
Anna was very knowledgeable as she is from Barcelona and told us lots of local customs and legends.
We had a fantastic time and would definitely advise anyone, even if you've never ""Segwayed"" before, to give it a go.",
174,Wander and Wonder,"3,236 reviews",
175,Great place to visit and get lost in the streets,"We had Claudio as our guide. He was very helpful and patient with training on how to use Segway in the correct way.
He was very informative and he made the whole experience very delightful",
176,Surprising,"We did a family group e-bike tour and our guide was Eric. He was extremely knowledgeable, friendly.and helpful. Tour was amazing too - took so many pics and e-bike is the way to see parts of Barcelona you wouldn't see otherwise",
177,Unique Area With Great Archtitecture,"Our tour guide Sharon was lovely and full of knowledge.
Defo recommend the Segway tour as it’s a fun way to explore the city and it’s sights",
178,Get Lost & Enjoy,Just got back from a 2 hour segway tour with Sophie. She made us all feel at ease and was very knowledgeable about the area. Would highly recommend ..especially if you have teens!,
179,Awesome vs Creapy.,Superb experience and the staff were just wonderful! And it was his first expedition too!!!! Thinking to organise again in this trip,
180,Don't miss the Gothic Quarter!,"Anke was our guide and she did an amazing job throughout. Most of our group had never used a Segway before. She was a patient, experienced coach and got us all riding confidently, in a very short amount of time.

She took us on a tour of key sites in Barcelona, and was well versed in the history of them. She gave is many useful follow-up tips and suggestions for the rest of our time in Barcelona.

She even went out of her way to help our daughter fully experience the trip while attending to the whole group in 2 languages (ours was a mixed German and English group).

The offering was a great value, the company well organized, and assigned guides so that there were no more than 6 participants in any group. We did this near the end of our week in Barcelona—and felt that it was the best group tour by far that we had taken.",
181,Very neat,"We went on a Segway tour with Chavi in English. His English was excellent, had a great sense of humor, and we had a wonderful time.",
182,Lovely stroll.,I booked the tour through Go City and it was definitely one of the best things I did whilst in Barcelona. Having never been on a segway before Hernindo our guide was great with me I felt very confident. This is a much book experience.,
183,Best place to stay in Barcelona - close to everything!,"Tomás was my tour guide today, he was so welcoming and knowledgeable, it was the most fun and informative tour I've ever been on and I can't recommend it enough. Erica was so lovely and helpful and couldn't do enough to help, she helped me to rearrange my tour and times, she was so patient and welcoming, I will definitely be back.",
184,Get away from the Ramblas and explore this part of town!,"When we booked our trip we saw we could do this with our Go City pass if we booked in advance so emailed when we were over and booked and we weren’t disappointed.

Before we even arrived we had fantastic communication via email and what’s app with Erica

We arrived and were greeted promptly. Our tour guide Xavi was friendly and had a wonderful sense of humour.

I took my 20 year old son and there was a couple from Columbia and Mike from Arizona. All 5 of us were Rookies to Segways and Xavi quickly put us at ease with the Segway and controlling them

We stopped and learned about history and visited sights including the magnificent church Basilica of Santa Maria del Mar, the port and even the beach

Plenty of photo opportunities

No Segway option on Strava so did as an e bike

We highly recommend for 2 hours of fun and wanted to keep the Segways

Thank you Erica and Xavi

Keep up the great work",
185,Best piece of Barca,"1,557 reviews",
186,Gothic Must,"A must-see for history buffs, this tour has an amazing and deeply knowledgable guide (my guide was Catherine), a truly compelling, tragic, and moving storyline, artifacts that you can see and touch, a not-too-far walk around central Barcelona, and even a coffee break... So much detail on historical events that continue to resonate in Spain and all over the world. The story is complicated and depressing, but Catherine does a masterful job of bringing it all into focus with her detailed stories, props, and artifacts. Highly recommended and worth every penny. Several on my tour were repeat customers, bringing friends, which speaks to the quality of the tour. Wear shoes that are comfy for standing and walking; dress for the weather, with a hat or sunglasses on sunny days, and bring water on hot days.",
187,Lovely memories,"This was a remarkable experience. Catherine's knowledge base was matched by her passion for the subject matter. Because of the lively Q&A and her desire to address questions fully, the session went over by an hour or more. More of a university level mini-course than a walk for casual touritists. I would do additional tours with her in a heartbeat!",
188,Highly recommended,"We had a GREAT experience with Roberto as he led us through to all it's highlights. Great stories, history, side notes, quips etc., As another reviewer here said, it may help if he did wear a mic and did speak a bit slower- but we could follow everything said as we were up front. He was knowledgeable and funny - and he was the best guide vs all teh paid tours we did in 3 countries! Go Roberto and thank you Purple Umbrella tours!",
189,Well worth it,"This really was the highlight of my recent visit to Barcelona.

Nick has an encyclopedlic knowledge of the Spanish Civil War and its wider context. Anyone who can explain the tensions within the Spanish Leftist factions on a sheet of A3 clearly knows his stuff!

I knew a little about the Spanish Civil War already but the tour has hugely added to my knowledge and the reading list provided will take a while to work through.

Nick is a passionate and engaging speaker, always ready for questions but never talking down to his audience. He brought the events of 1936-39 alive, looking at both sides of the conflict and showing us a number of pictures, photographs and items from the conflict. He humanises the war by looking at two particular individuals caught up in it and their stories.

You can join this tour with zero knowledge of the Spanish Civil War and finish it informed, moved and keen to learn more. With fascism once more on the rise in Europe, there's never been a better time to learn from history.",
190,Favourite place in Barcelona,"Don't miss this tour. For years, we've done history tours whenever we travel in Europe. By far, Catherine's Spanish Civil War Tour was the best one yet. She's a unique combination of a great teacher and an inspired dramatist. Never a dull moment on this fascinating tour. Very accessible, no need for any background. Catherine should write and produce her own documentary!

We especially enjoyed how she focused on the lives of the people of Barcelona during this tumultuous time, their suffering and their courage, highlighting one particular young man. She brought a complex history to life in all its facets, describing the origins of the war, and deftly revealing the various forces at work, the dramatic battles, and the unique situation in Barcelona at that time. Good pacing, Interactive. Open to all questions. Illustrated with an archive she carried in her backpack, and by moving passages from George Orwell's Homage to Catalonia. Presented with passion. A very emotional experience for us, and a great inspiration to do whatever we can in our own circumstances to work for peace in the world. Unforgettable!",
191,Narrow Streets Among Historic Buildings,Don't miss this tour! Catherine made the history of the Civil War in Barcelona come alive. Her knowledge of the subject is encyclopedic. And she shares all she knows with great passion and clarity. Her tour has been one of the highlights of our stay in Spain.,
192,Amazing stay!,"This is a brilliant tour - go if you are interested in the history of Barcelona, in the Spanish Civil War and/or the politics of the left. Nick is very knowledgable and a good communicator. The use of photographs and other artefacts is really innovative and involving. I’d give it 6 stars if I could.",
193,Gothic Quarter was a convenient place to stay,This is a brilliant tour - extremely knowledgeable and giving real insight into the subject and what happened in Barcelona. Catherine our guide was truly excellent.,
194,Worth a wander around,"A fantastic tour of Barcelona from a very different perspective. My two teenage daughters and I did a private tour with Catherine on Good Friday. Catherine is incredibly knowledegable, friendly and approachable. All three of us had a fantastic time, and learned so much that changed our view of the rest of our time in Barcelona - in a good way! Highly recommend!",
195,Cool streets with so much energy,"1,557 reviews",
196,Wandering back in time,"Real highlight of our trip. Nick was a super knowledgeable guide, he did an excellent job of weaving in individual histories to the larger conflict. He also has a great collection of artifacts to share. Was easy to communicate with and accommodated our children gracefully into his tour.",
197,Go!!!,"With her comprehensive knowledge of the Spanish Civil War, Catherine conducted the tour with a passion that matched her expertise. Focusing on the human drama and complexity of the period, she unraveled a tale that defies comprehension yet still connected the disparate pieces of the narrative while addressing the individual questions and concerns of the participants. Catherine’s presentation enabled me to better understand my late mother’s experience of the Civil War and its impact on her life. By tour’s end, I felt that I was actually there.",
198,Great to walk through,"I am not a history buff and knew next to nothing about the Spanish Civil War before our tour with guide Catherine . Her Irish accent made it easy to listen with our American ears :) She took a complex subject and spellbindingly explained so you can feel what the residents of Barcelona experienced in those turbulent times. Her depth of knowledge didn’t allow for easy generalization but her presentation, with maps artifacts and short quotes from first hand material, made it comprehensible. She had us teary eyed with the moving stories, starting with poverty of the Great Depression and ending with the Nazi trials and brave resistance from those suffering from the Civil War and ending up captured in WW II.
As a 3-hr walking tour I expected more walking but we tending to move a block at a time and then time for presentation and discussion. she catered her details to the interests of the dozen or so participants. again I’m not a scholar nor history buff but every minute of the tour was engaging.",
199,Feels like stepping back in time,"Incredible and informative tour. Catherine our tour guide knew everything about the topic, yet made it human and relatable. Our family matriarch survived the Spanish Civil War and the tour helped all four of us to understand her and her life struggles on a personal level, along with all of Spain in the period. I couldn't recommend this tour and it's guide higher.",
200,WARNING :Robbery on the street!!!! Gotic Quarter - Carrer de Ferran,"This was a fantastic tour from Placa de Catalunya to Placa San Felip neri. Catherine provides an excellent crash course covering 1930s Spanish politics. She gives lots of information with passion and enthusiasm with an awesome Irish accent. Catherine uses the Barcelona architecture, photos, and artifacts they have collected over the years. She also has her beat up copy of Orwell's ""Homage to Catalonia"" that she uses to give us some eyewitness description of what was happening in the war and on the Ramblas. My 15 year old daughter enjoyed it and it was 4 hours of interactive learning. I will also say that the tour participants added to the rich experience. Well worth it!",
201,"If you're tired, you won't miss anything by not doing this.","Catherine led us through the stops and brought history to life with both the artifacts she carried and also the lively way in which she explained the occurrences. We were a small group and she encouraged a dialogue as we went, which was also fantastic. This tour is a Barcelona highlight and more: I’ve taken many European history tours and this one was exceptional. The history resonates today quite loudly, which also recommends the tour.",
202,A bit of a come-down,"This was a fascinating tour, led by Nick, who delivered a huge amount of information in a concise and understandable fashion to a rapt audience. His delivery was terrific and the use of photographs and memorabilia of the actual civil war made the tour very evocative. I would thoroughly recommend it.",
203,No refund if holiday cancelled.,"Nick weaves together the human stories with the bigger picture in such an engaging, accesible and moving way. His knowledge and enthusiasm are next level!

History comes more alive if you are walking the ground and this tour does that of course, but this is especially so with Nick there and his cast of characters.

You will get up close to some of the buildings associated with Orwell during his time in the city. Also the tour stops at places that saw the opening moves and tragedy during the citizens of Barcelona (and the sympathetic individuals of the world who came to Spain) as they struggled against fascism.

The original 1930's SCW objects that Nick brings along add a tactile, real and often touching element to a tour that will linger long in the memory. Book early, this is a tour that should be top of your list when you visit Barcelona!!

",
204,Free Walking tour no show,"Catherine, an academic and historian, did an excellent job breaking down the confusion that is the Spanish Civil War, making it interesting and understandable. She did so with clarity, enthusiasm and humor, owning a true talent for teaching.

The tour lasted 3.5 hours but felt much quicker. Part of that was how engaging Catherine was. The other part was getting the opportunity to sit on benches a couple of times plus learning more while sipping yummy coffees in a cafe together.

This tour is a true gem, run by folks who love history and love even more the sharing of it. They are a pleasure to work with and quick in their communications.

I would recommend this tour both for people already knowledgable of the Civil War as well as those who know next to nothing. Everyone with even a bit of curiously and love for history will enjoy it greatly.",
205,Guide didn't show up,"Unbelievable. Learned so much from Catherine who was extremely knowledgeable in the history but also passionate, lively and able to show us amazing artifacts. It was truly an academic tour de force but so much fun and so interesting too. This is a must event for anyone who wants to have fun while also being an informed traveler and learning about where you are and what you are experiencing. Thank you from Deborah Agus and Robert Kleinman",
206,Interesting night out,"1,557 reviews",
207,Do it Yourself,This tour is just wonderful. Nick (host) really brings 1930’s Barcelona alive by bringing actual items and photographs from the period. He explained the complexities of the various groups in the war in a straightforward manner. Nick brought the human touch to a piece of history.,
208,Fun free walking tour with JC,"Excellent tour! Very detailed, but engaging nonetheless. Nick answered everyone’s questions really well and tailored his your to people of all knowledge levels and backgrounds. He was very personable and made an effort to get to know everyone and remember all our names.",
209,Tour with Juan Carlos,"Nick brought the history of the Spanish Civil War alive in a way that I've never seen done at any other historical presentation in a classroom, film, national park, or historic site. He brought along many old pictures and artifacts. Perhaps this was a bit geeky but it really deepened my understanding of Barcelona, Spain, and how what happened in Spain influenced WWII. Great for Orwell readers. Not a tour for little kids.",
210,Tapas and Flamenco Experiance,"My partner and I joined this walking tour, which details the political and ideological conflicts within Barcelona during Spanish Civil War, with a specific focus on left-factions. Nick was a truly gracious, studious, and powerful guide throughout; weaving high-level historical and geopolitical material together with the deeply personal stories of those who joined POUM, the CNT, and the Republican cause against fascism. We were particularly struck by how deep and broad his knowledge was, fielding a range of questions from the audience with lightening-fast answers and a deeply humanistic outlook on the conflict. While neither of us are sentimentalist about history or our politics, we both spent the remainder of the day gob-smacked by the tour and how affecting we found it.

We will be recommending this to all.",
211,Marvellous tour,"A wonderful trip through the alternately inspiring and sad history of the war that presaged WW2. Nick’s tour makes history come alive in the sites throughout central Barcelona. Best part: the interaction between Nick and the people taking the walk. Nick deals with questions honestly and skilfully. Be ready for some walking. Not necessary, but those who read up a bit on the history of this war or have read Orwell’s memoir of his time as a volunteer soldier in Spain will get even more from the walk.",
212,Kayaking and Snorkeling Costa Brava,"This tour with Nick Lloyd is unparalleled. Do it. He covers the reasons behind the war, the international background and effects. Its legacy. I'm a history nerd and I loved It. My wife isn't a nerd but she was touched by the humanity of it.
On our tour were a South Korean, an Irish lady, English and Americans. We ranged from about 20 to 60 in age and we all seemed engaged and attentive.

This three and a half hours tour ended up at almost four hours with our questions being answered knowledgeably and with understanding and compassion.

You will not be disappointed!",
213,Great Way to Enjoy the Ocean!,"A very interesting tour which explains and elaborates on the underlying political tensions and brings to life the characters who played a significant part in the war in Barcelona. Nick took us to key locations and showed us photos and artefacts he had passionately collected, making it very easy to imagine the harsh reality of life there during the 1930s. I would definitely recommend if you are open to spending a few hours delving deeper into the recent history of Barcelona.",
214,Fun unusual tour - highly recommend,"Brilliant.

I was initially quite skeptical about how the whole 'walking museum' tour would work - but it was executed flawlessly. Nick (the tour guide) has quite literally written the book on the experience of Barcelona in the Civil War - and has accumulated enough gems and curios (to say nothing of the stories) to make the three and a half hour tour fly by.

Delightfully analog. Excellent value for money. Compulsory for any English Speaking history buff who's interested in the Civil War history. Do it.",
215,tour guide makes it fun even for teens ,),"We did this tour with Catherine. What a great tour. Clearly Catherine has a passion for the Spanish Civil War in Barcelona. She brought so much to the tour, so much amazing background information. She is a gifted communicator (I was going to say storyteller but I didn’t want to imply any of it was fiction). She really brought the war in Barcelona to life. Her group is constantly on the lookout for Spanish Civil War memorabilia which also makes things so real. The 3 1/2+ hours flew by…we both thoroughly enjoyed the tour and highly recommend it to anyone."
216,Gothic area walking tour,"40,414 reviews",
217,Good Flamingo show but tapas experience was very disappointing,"What can I say about this beautiful area? I loved roaming the streets and laneways, looking up at the gorgeous architecture. Just so beautiful, but good lock finding the same street twice! LOL",
218,JUAN CARLOS TOUR 16 JULY 2019,"So much to see and very interesting. Something new to see everywhere you look, plus lots of cute little cafes and tapas bars.
Yes there is homelessness here and late at night you might get offered drugs but just keep walking! Barcelona is like every other city, just use your common sense and you will be absolutely fine! :) Really recommend coming here and getting lost in the streets",
219,Juan Carlos tour,Too bad we walked through on our own. It would have been great to have a guide explain all we saw because there were lots of great buildings and monuments along the way.,
220,Very Enjoyable,"We loved this area. The narrow streets and very cool buildings made for a nice afternoon.

We found some nice shops especially a great Christmas store Kaethe Wohlfahrt. So nice to see
beautiful ornaments and other decorations made in Germany not China.
This is a very interesting part of Barcelona.",
221,Passports and Money stolen by out tour guide,My wife and I happened to come down here twice during our stay. It's close to the La Rambla area. Looking at the buildings & architectural detail was an incredible experience. The narrow streets that took you here and there. The Barcelona Basilica is located in this area as well as the Del Mar church. Just take time to enjoy checking out various shops / bars / restaurants int he area. Allow yourself to just get lost and pick a direction,
222,Aidan is the don,"The old part of central Barcelona, including the cathedral area.
It has highlights, but also dirty and (especially during the night) creapy and desolated streets.
A must see for every visitor, but also beware of pickpockts.",
223,Hospitality of guids were perfect environement can't be influenced,"So much fun- Great food and sights. The history is everywhere. See the Cathedral and the churches. Felt very safe. Alot of tourists, but the crowds were not overwhelming. We stayed in the Gothic quarter and would certainly stay in that area again .",
224,Six hours includes 2 hour traffic jams,"A must visit when in Barcelona, lots to see and lots of shops
It does get very crowded so be prepared for this",
225,excellent day out,"Wow, what a beautiful part of the city. Everywhere you look the buildings are just stunning, it feels so different from the main part of town and so much to see. Really lovely stroll around this area.",
226,Amazing Guide and Trip,"We stayed at the H10 Madison (separate review) in the Barri Gothic and would highly recommend making this your center of operations when visiting Barcelona. The location is superb for seeing most everything you would want to see (except Park Guell and Sagrada Familia, which are best seen with a guide anyway).",
227,Fantastic Tour,"Fantastic experience. Helpful staff, amazing chef who shared his expertise in a fun and friendly way. We enjoyed a 4 course meal that we had prepared, with wine, to end our evening. Highly recommend this activity",
228,Tapas and Flamenco BAD,"This is a great part of Barcelona to wander around. Lots of interesting little shops and bodegas, and I felt totally safe there even though I was alone.",
229,Awesome Mediterranean adventure!,"Best фBest place to get lost in the streets of Barcelona) Beautiful and cosy wherever you go. Locals warn you to be wary of thieves, but luckily we didn't encounter any.",
230,DIDN’T SHOW UP!!!,"My second visit to Barcelona, and I look forward for a third!, the Gothic Quarter is a must. It is a small world itself, not to be missed.",
231,"stinky, probably deaf and rude bus driver","This is really a nice place to go, there are a lot of street artists in this area.
I walked across this overpass and hoped it would bring me and my friends some luck :)",
232,Well organised trip to monserrat,My wife & i went through so many of these must see alleys some of which with historical structures & churches/cathedrals to visit and/or take photo’s of besides all kinds of shops you can stop buy and surely end up shopping as well. So the walk is mixed and worth it. Recommended.,
233,"Bus to Barcelona. Angry bus driver; very rude. No toilets and long journey, bad time keeping. AVOID","You haven’t been to Barcelona if you did
Not stroll through narrow streets of
Gothic quarter, visited one of many pubs or just take it all in - the atmosphere, architecture,
Culture.",
234,Brilliant day. Definitely recommend,"The gothic quarter was by far one of my favourite places to walk around in Barcelona. As someone who hates big crowds but enjoys the city sites, I thought this was the perfect middle ground. Incredible architecture, some nice restaurants and not too many people. Really worth going for a few hours to explore.",
235,Excursion to Barcelona Zoo,"I love walking around areas like this in any city. It feels authentic (even though I'm sure it isn't anymore). The pedestrian streets are narrow and not straight, with random smaller alleys breaking off here and there, amongst the historic buildings. You find lovely hidden restaurants and shops when you're just wandering and not necessarily looking for something.",
236,Great trip,"We rented an Air BnB in the Gothic Quarter and it was the right choice. The location has everything and is a beautiful part of the city. There are cafes, bars, churches and the market! The beach is also close by. Highly recommend staying in this area!",
237,Absolutely delightful,"40,414 reviews",
238,Under estimated travel time,We stayed in the Gothic Quarter in a 5 star hotel about two blocks from La Ramblas. Although the neighborhood seemed ok by day we did note that the hotel had several doormen out front at all times and we assumed this was for security. We did not go out at night but by day we felt very safe. Pick pockets are said to be rampant in Barcelona and many apparently ride scooters so beware and keep valuables close. There is much great architecture to see here. We walked by ourselves on our first day and came back with a local guide who showed us around our last day.,
239,Driver insinuated that I was stolen the company because my ticket got cut and didn’t let me go inside the bus,"We did a self guided walk around this “old part” of the city.
Beautiful cobble stones although not kept as clean as other Spanish cities with similar old towns.
Highlights of our walk included the Roman pillars and the Sant Felipe Neri church.",
240,Bus plans salou,"We loved walking through the Gothic quarter. So much history that can seen as you walk around, beautiful shops and even a Christmas shop. Not as busy in April and a nice break from La rambla",
241,Not recommended,"Love the walk here. Wandered around to admire the building, the architecture. There are atractions you should get to like the Catalan Cathedral and Pont Bisbe but the narrow streets themselves are already an atraction. There are also alot of shops around.",
242,"Misleading website, it is not on line booking.",Totally worth visiting! Breathtaking narrow city streets. Brilliant architecture. Wonderful shops throughout.,
243,The way to travel,"A really interesting area of narrow streets, apartment buildings, shops and restaurants. Wondeful to walk through and appreciate.",
244,Worst bus transport system in Europe????,"We stayed in this area for a reason, this has a feel of a historic city you don’t get in the United States. The pedestrian streets were fun to explore along with the shops, bars and restaurants. We absolutely loved it!",
245,Tours don't cater for elderly and disabled people,"WARNING: Me and my friend were walking on Monday evening around 10PM, 20.03.2023 from Placa de Sant Jaume along Carrer de Ferran towards Ramblas. Let me also mention that we are both men, 185cm tall and sportily built, 40 years old. At one point, about 70m from the Ramblas street, I slowed down a bit and my friend was at that moment about 7-8m ahead of me. I was suddenly knocked to the ground by 3 men from my back and 1 of them pulled an expensive steel watch from my hand and the other two held me on the ground, from the third jerk the bracelet on the watch opened or broke and all three robbers immediately ran away into a narrow side street with my watch. I ran after them for about 50 meters and lost them, they probably entered some building. Everything happened in about 10 seconds, and I should mention that I am neither small nor weak, but I was not aware of what happened from that shock. My friend heard me only when I shouted his name, but they had already slipped into that small street. I was wearing a feather jacket and the watch was sticking out on my wrist because I was often taking pictures with my phone. People be very, very careful, these are well trained and skilled bandits. There were still a lot of passers-by on the street, and only 1 Asian approached me and ran after them with me.

-I attachment are photos where this crime happened.

-I read that reporting to the police won't help, and that the police won't search for your values, which is a very bad advertisement for the tourism of this beautiful country.

-IMPORTANT : I hope that in the future the police will solve this very ugly and big problem of all well-intentioned tourists and that they will understand the magnitude and seriousness of this problem.",
246,Cheap to use,It's basically a stroll through a really beautiful old part of Barcelona with shops. We enjoyed it.,
247,non show bus at reus airport,"While the alleys and small streets are interesting, this is so highly touristed that it's almost not worth seeing. It's filled with touristy stores and alot of mediocre restaurants (although there are some real gems in there, too). If you are not comfortable in crowds, I would also caution that this area is very busy, even in the off-season.",
248,Plana bus ticket,"2,056 reviews",
249,Bus drivers very helpful.,"I booked a tour with this company on 15th January for a visit in March. The airline cancelled my flight on the 27th of January and I've been trying since then to get a refund. DO NOT BOOK IN ADVANCE, if anything goes wrong, you will not get your money back.",
250,Always on the go,I booked the 1pm free walking tour on weekend in Barcelona. I got a confirmation email AND a reminder email and yet when I turned up to the meeting location the bar was closed and no guide in sight. I had arrived early as advised in the email so hung around (in a dodgy alley mind you) for 20mins and still no guide appeared. I understand cancelling a free tour if not enough people sign on but I got no communication other than a reminder email to be there. A bit disappointing as I had essentially structured my day around this tour and only had 1 day to see Barcelona. 0 stars if I could. Cancel if you must but at least notify those who did sign up.,
251,Montserrat visit 30th September 2022,"We went to the meeting place (Travel Bar) at 3PM (in fact we came 10 minutes early) after registering places online in the morning. There were subsequent reminders to show up at the place on time and no word of cancellation. So we went to the location and asked a guy at travel bar if it was the correct location (and yes, it was!) and then they said they couldn't reach the tour guide at 3.15PM. By then we've waited for a bit and we thought it didn't look like the tour was continuing. Nonetheless, we double checked with a guy there again, and I think he couldn't reach the guide so the tour probably wasn't going to happen.

Was quite disappointed actually, because we planned a day's activities round it and even went there early. There were no notifications that it was going to be cancelled whatsoever so we just showed up. Thankfully, Sandeman Europe had a tour going on at 4PM that day. We quickly signed up online and made our way to the meeting point, where our lovely guide Leon showed everyone on the walking tour (including me) around.

Enjoyed the walking tour in the end, but it was thanks to Sandeman Europe though. Maybe it was a weekday at 3PM so they decided not to do it even though it was listed on the website and we signed up and all. Not really sure what went on but getting stood up didn't feel very nice i guess",
252,Great,We went to see a Flamengo show and eat some tapas in a restaurant nearby. Our guide was very friendly and informative. The show was not our kind of entertainment but we wanted to experience what the city of Barcelona was all about. Dining on tapas with different kind of people coming from all parts of the world was awesome. Had a very nice night out!,
253,Local Travel,Save your money and walk around by yourself. Nothing exciting about this tour. I learned more by exploring on my own.,
254,Excellent service.,Juan Carlos is a well-informed and experienced tour guide and he seems to know exactly which facts you want to learn about Barcelona. He's friendly and approachable. I had fun and that's why I was very surprised to see that most people only gave him a few euros or nothing at all for his efforts and time.,
255,👍🏻,We did the walking tour with Juan Carlos. It took about 2 hours end felt exactly long enough. He seemed to know answers to all questions asked and knew fun and interesting facts about many places of interest.,
256,Great day out,"It was shocking - the decription of what would be of the night was very different to what actually was shown.
Met at a bar where we met the person taking the tour - mainly wanting money and no interest in us.
we then what felt like a 3 hour tour walk to the show - it was cooling off and she would wait for everyone to be quiet.
The show was not long and mainly the music and singing - the guy danced most and one short dance with the woman - was expecting so much more but it was the only good thing of the evening.
We then walked for ages to a grotty small resturant with just us people from the show who went in.
The tour rep then left us all there and we ALL HAD TO SIT AT A BIG TABLE TOGETHER! We were on a hen do and could of died! food was TERRIBLE
No good service - had to keep asking for drinks!
We got up and just left! was awful! no direction of where we were or how to get back!
Shocked and appalled we spent the money for it",
257,Deliberately Misled by “Unhappy” Driver,"We had Juan Carlos as our tour guide and when we met him we instantly liked him. He told us of his connection to Canada story which was so nice that he made an effort to make us feel welcome.

Tour was amazing and very interesting and kept our interest even after just arriving in Barcelona with little sleep.

Would definitely recommend to family and friends.

Thank you Juan Carlos to making our first day in Barcelona such a memorable experience.",
258,worst bus company ever- joke of a company,"We had a fantastic time with my family on the 17th of August. Huge thank you to Tim , he made the whole experience as amazing as it could have been.
I highly recommend it to everyone!",
259,Very good service,"2,056 reviews",
260,Wonderful trip to Barcelona,My daughter and I wanted to experience the ocean and coast without just sitting on an overcroweded beach baking. This was perfect ... tourguide Tim was fantastic and funny but kept us safe. The scenery is unreal and the entire thing was well planned and executed. We felt very safe the whole time and the use of time was really good.,
261,3 Brits and a Catalan,"A few friends and I had the best time this August on the 6 hour kayaking and snorkeling tour of costa brava. It was about a 1 hour bus ride (very comfy bus) and the scenery was breathtaking. Then you are taken care of from getting the equipment and are taught properly how to use it. Tim was the best tour guide, very fun and informational. It was the best day, well worth the price!",
262,Free Gothic walking tour,My friend and I went on this tour on Sunday 28 July and Juan Carlos was fantastic - he had fun anecdotes from everywhere around the Gothic Quarter and a fabulous sense of humor. He knew his stuff and made sure no-one was left behind. I am very into Art and found he was super knowledgeable about the area and showed us some galleries and street art which was fascinating. It was really enjoyable and I would thoroughly recommend. Was nice to have a beer and a chat about his own experiences of the city at the Travel Bar at the end .Thank you!,
263,Great overview of Barcelona!,"We booked this free walking tour ($=tip) through Tripadvisor and TravelBar. Our 2hr tour went by very fast as we thoroughly enjoyed our time with our guide Juan Carlos who was a history major and has an expansive knowledge of history, architecture, politics, and art and was able to point out many things about this interesting location that we would have never noticed on our own. Juan Carlos's knowledge and personality even made the tour fun for our 17yr olds - and that's saying something!",
264,Fabulous Natalia !!,"Loved this tour. Juan Carlos was an awesome guide , full of knowledge. I learned so much during our walk. It was great that he pointed out some smaller details we would never have seen or known where to look. Fun guide and amazing sights.",
265,Good way to get foundational info for your first visit,"The only highlight of this tour was the flamingo show. For the rest is was one of the worst tours we have ever done. Upon arrival, the guide was more concerned collecting everybody’s outstanding fees than being welcoming and engaging. We chose a small group tour as we like personal experiences of a small group. Along the way our guide stopped a couple of times to share some information without waiting for the whole group to be together before speaking. Thus not being able to hear anything she shared. After the flamingo show (which was amazing) she lead us to the restaurant where the tapas tasting was going to take place. She had us all seated at tables and left us with “ I am leaving now...you’ll be in the hands of the waiters “ not emplaining anything about what we were going to taste etc. The waiters just brought plates of tapas to the table without explaining anything (which I think its the role of the tour guide). We had to ask a couple of times to refill the Sangria jar (2 jars per 8 people) which was advertised as unlimited Sangria. The restaurant felt like a cheap quick stop for a tour company who has no idea of Barcelona and its traditions of tapas. We did another foodtour the following day with another company, which was excellent, and was shocked at how bad the tapas experience was with this specific company!! Avoid them at all costs!",
266,GREAT Experience with Roberto!,"We had a great time walking the streets of Barcelona. We saw some gorgeous little shops and learnt all sorts of hidden things about the city. Great tour Juan.

268,Fantastic tours. Do not miss out,"Our tour guide was great, she was extremely knowledgeable and friendly. She shared a lot of history behind the places we visited.",
269,Gaudi and Mel in the rain.,"My friend and I did the snorkel and kayaking trip with this company. Worst day of my life. The trip it self was amazing, beautiful beaches, crystal clear water. But on our way home we discovered our passports, credit cards and cash has been stolen. We suspect it to be the guide as they were the only ones who had access to where our bags were being left “securely”. Spent 3 hours in a police station after the tour, getting back to our room at 2am and we are now stuck in Barcelona until our passports arrive. To make things worse once we found out what happened to our belongings we called the company for help. They then called back 4 times- not to help us, but to “reassure us” that it was none of their employees and told us we were pick pocketed- which is impossible because our bags never left our site until we locked them away. Safe to say this completely ruined my trip. My advice steer completely clear from this company, do the tour but with anyone else.",

271,Guided tour with Dominika is highly recommended!,Coming to Barca we thought that we could do it all but we were so wrong. Booked a tour in advance with the free walking tour company and we were so lucky to have Aidan as our guide. Man did a wonderful job and made our time at Barca much more of an experience! Highly recommend!,
272,Free walking tour Guadi with Dominika!,"Overall it was nice experince and I will repeat it for sure if I will have a chance.
The missing point is for nature because of cold water on 18th June and lack of sea life in place were we snorkeling.
I still have in life memory the sea life in Egypt from last year so from thsi point of view I can tell that Costa Brava coast is without life. If you tak this into consideration you will be very happy with service the guids provide you.
For discussion is laso cost of this advanture €80 versu the return flight Vienna <> Barcelona for €60 ...",
273,Perfect way to experience Barcelona through eyes of a local,"We did this excursion in June while in Barcelona. The main reason we booked it was because it was a 6 hour excursion in the ocean. We ended up being stuck in, what seemed like normal daily traffic, for 2 hours before getting to the beach. We got our equipment and quickly started kayaking and snorkeling. After about 30 mins of snorkeling our guide tells us we’re going to another spot but we have to be careful because the wind is very strong, “but don’t worry the wind will help push you”. I felt like I was on a survival show. No matter how hard we paddled we didn’t seem to move anywhere. We kept getting carried out to sea. We finally made it to the “cliff diving” spot which was pretty cool but it’s not for everyone. You have to jump out of your kayak, climb up into rocks, jump, then struggle to get back on your kayak. We were there for a while, a lot longer than the snorkeling which was unfortunate because only about 4 out of the 15+ group we had jumped. The rest of us just sat there floating. Then our guide tells us he has to cut the kayaking short because of the weather, we kayaked back to shore and had the sandwiches then waited around for about 45 mins for the bus to go back. Let me say that I very much appreciated their concern for our safety. However, I’m sure they’ve been doing by this for a while so they should know the traffic patterns and when to avoid high traffic on what days. I had Waze and google maps on my phone so I know they have the capability of at least knowing when to avoid high traffic times. The same with the weather, check the weather and plan accordingly instead of rushing us through the activities that we paid for
, have back up activities planned. Offer water sports and snorkeling near the shore, slides, water volleyball, anything rather than rushing us back and making us wait around. Unfortunately it wasn’t what I was expecting and it was a disappointing trip. It just felt very haphazardly put together. Plus they should specify that the “6 hour excursion” advertised INCLUDES the travel time.",
274,Wonderful Tour!,the guide was good fun had fantastic day out kayaking and snorkelling also has chance to do some cliff jumping,
275,Very nice Gothic Quater Tour,The guide I had was very relax and nice. He made it such a worthwhile trip and I loved the 4 different levels of cliff jumping. I would go back again when I get the chance. Thanks for a fun time!,
276,Two excellent walking tours,"A group of 10 of us were in Barcelona this weekend for a hen do. We wanted a weekend of sightseeing and Joe, our tour guide, was excellent. He was extremely knowledgeable and had a great sense of humour. We had a fantastic two hours around the Gothic Quarter and saw so many things we would otherwise have skipped by or not understood.
We also asked for a recommendation on where we could go in the evening and Joe suggested a place called Paradiso, a secret bar, which was a brilliant choice and the bride to be was delighted (as were we!)
We had a wonderful weekend away and the tour was a definite highlight for us - thankyou!",
277,Best walking tours in Barcelona,The tour we did with Juliana was great however she recommended a tapas and flamenco evening that was not good. The food at the tapas restaurant was terrible and at the last minute they told us we only had standing room available for the flamenco dance that was 35-40 minutes. I would not recommend getting suckered into doing the tapas and flamenco.,
278,Definitely a must,"An all around great experience kayaking, cliff jumping and snorkelling at Costa Brava. Our guide was super energetic and funny! Well worth it, would recommend this.",
279,Great first activity in Barcelona,"I booked a tour well in advance and even had email correspondence with them afterwards. Walked across the city to get to the tour, walked passed the Travel Bar half an hour early and it was closed. I came back ten minutes before the tour time and 4 other people were also waiting. 15 minutes after the tour time, we gave up and left. Have had no emails to apologise since.

Would not trust if you have limited time in Barcelona. Book with another group to make sure it happens!",

282,10/10 Mel is amazing,Bus stops are very hard to locate. Buses are often late. Bus drivers are very rude and drive like crazy. The music was so loud on the bus that I felt like I was going deaf. There aren’t any toilets and the buses were stinky and the seats were very bad and there was very little leg room.,
283,Great tour- recommended,"We used bus plana for an excursion to monserrat. Was easy to book at one of for many plana offices in salou. We paid €38 each and got picked up near our hotel. Monserrat is a beautiful place in the mountains and our guide ?Benny was informative and had a relaxed and humorous persona. Our trip included a visit in the Chapel to see the Black Madonna. And the train the goes up the mountain. we also visited a chocolate factory in Cava ,was lovely to see other parts of spain. Worth the very reasonable price imo",
284,"Super guide Natalia, highly recommended","Bus to Barcelona. Angry bus driver; very rude - went crazy at my girlfriend for having a coffee on the bus in a cup even though we weren’t warned. No toilets and long journey, bad time keeping all day, absolute shambles of an experience. AVOID at all costs.",
285,Highly recommended tour !,Did the panoramic Barcelona tour with Roman and the driver Fabien. Roman's knowledge of the relevant history was really interesting and Fabiens ability to drive around Barcelona in such a huge bus was very impressive. Would definitely recommend.,

289,Lovely tour !!,"Booked bus tickets to have a day trip in Barcelona leaving from La Pineda. When booking I was reassured the travel time would be 1 hour each way, however when waiting on the day the bus was 20 minutes late along with the journey to Barcelona ending up being 2 hours. On the way back we were just under 3 hours to reach our hotel again. The ride itself was made longer by facilities on the bus not working. Also to add the travel time was not due to traffic.",
290,Great tour and guide - fantastic city,"O have a triple with my boyfriend from salou to Barcelona and we bought a return ticket.
When we were taking the bus back to Salou the driver didn’t accept the tickets because it was cut. I explained hundred times that was two chances: or the first drive cut it my mistake or it was cut because it was rain etc.. the driver treat us as a horse applying that we are “stolen” the company using a ticket that is already used what make noooo sense as we came to salou yesterday 12/05 and the return tickets was for today 13/05/23.
So I think the driver is supposing that I used the ticket from Barcelona to salou already.. then my boyfriend and I teleported ourselves to barcelona again and want to use the same tickets agan.

I felt really distracted and disrespected as a tourist. He said I should said to the first driver to not cut it or ask him to sign (as I should know the rule). And he was just cutting our thicket more and more and more..
I is so frustrating, because we have no voice. Nobody he to help us to find a solution and the guy can just decide to let us behind accusing us as scammers. It should be treat in the court!
It is 22:29 in the night and we couldn’t go to salou to keep our tripe because of a person that do not análise basic thing and do see that what he was applying was impossible to be done. As the tickets was bought together as return and we are in Barcelona try to go back to salou.. what a absurd.

I’m pretty sure it wouldn’t be the treatment if I was Spanish and not a tourist.",

294,Avoid at all costs,"Advice for anyone trying to book an excursion using busplana website.
1. The website is the most difficult website I have ever used. It won't accept english postcodes. After several emails I was advised it doesn't accept letters and you have to put 00 in front of the numbers in your post code.
2. The online system is not a booking, it's a reservation, however you do pay up front. When you arrive in Spain you have to find a local busplana office to collect tickets and directions for excusions.
3. This is absolutely useless for those of us like me who will arrive late in the evening hoping to join a busplana excursion early the next day..
4. Cancellation does not automatically ensure an immediate refund, it has to go to the refunds office.
5. There is no way of receiving tickets on line.
The whole experience has been frustrating and difficult, the websute is misleading as it clearly says online booking. What is the point of booking online if you have to go to a ticket office to pick up paper tickets??This information is not provided at the start of the booking process and it's only when you have paid that you realise it's only a reservation. I can read Spanish and English so it's not a translation problem.",

296,Joyful experience,"From unuser friendly website to bus stops not showing destinations and timetable. I have pity on the the bus driver because they have to answer so many questions at every stop. No wonder they are so cranky, and late.

297,Worth every minute!,We did the Barcelona panoramic tour on Friday 14/10/22 the tour itself was great and very informative but one of our party is disabled and cannot walk very quickly the familia sagrada is more than half a mile away from were the bus stopped to let us visit the guide took us there but was walking very quickly there was other people in the crowd who were elderly and could not keep up this was pointed out to the guide by another member of our party to which the guide replied I don't slow down for just 1 person by this time our disabled party member was about 400 yards behind along with a few others and struggling we didn't no the way and if we lost the guide we would have been lost on the way back she sent us ahead before the rest but we got lost as trying to keep up going to the place we weren't watching the route we had taken the bus then left without us we were running down streets trying to catch and stop the bus luckily one of our party stopped it but the guide just snapped hurry up or were going without the rest of you this is a disgusting and disgraceful way in any country to treat disabled and elderly people and bus plana need to retrain their staff on how to treat disabled and elderly people as I'm sure they make up a large percentage of their customers each year,

Funny and get to know a good bit of history and a few good spots to go give a proper look over in our own time,"We stayed in La Pineda and found getting about very easy using this cheap bus service.

We were picked up on time from the designated spot in Salou and met by Roman our guide for the day. He was very friendly and informative. We were given ample free time in Montserrat around 4hrs to explore and grab some lunch.
After that we were taken to Stiges for a hour and a half where as a group we walked 15 minutes into town.
Our only negative was we were led a little too fast on the walking part so the group was separated with the head of the party being 400m ahead before the tail caught up.

We questioned him why he had told us that the bus went to Cap Salou, but he rudely dismissed us.

319,Leon loves Barcelona!,"I often look up free walking tours in larger cities because I know that the guides will be invested in being engaging and informative. Admittedly, I also like them because I know that sometimes plans change, and if something has to be dropped, a free walking tour is an easy thing to not feel too bad about skipping, especially when there is an understandable booking fee. I thought it was worth the 3 euro per person to secure a spot. I did misread the site though and saw the price difference for 1-8 people versus 12 euro per person for a group of 9 or more (but why wouldn’t you just break your group into smaller ones and book ahead?), and I thought that meant that the tour would be limited to 8 people. My bad. We had a group of about 20, maybe a few more, enough that I would think it would hard for the guide to interact a bit with each party, which is where I think that the at-the-guests-discretion tip is often decided.

I thought that our guide Lena, although not from Barcelona (Greece, maybe?), was lovely and informative. We were a bit tired, and had just gotten off a food tour, so I did zone out a bit during some of the history stretches, but at no fault of our guide’s, and some of the information was a repeat (although we wound up doing 4 tours of different sorts that covered mostly the Gothic Quarter and I rather liked the overlaps and variations on some information). We did cover quite a bit of ground and history in the span of 2.5 hours, and Lena did make an effort to chat with us between a couple of stops which I appreciated.

I suppose many guests would appreciate the mention of a suggested tip amount, but I found myself finding it a bit awkward for the guide to have to do that. I think maybe the suggested tip should be on the website (also so guests can plan ahead). I think I was honestly a bit surprised by the suggestion of 15 euros per person because that’s what we had budgeted, and I usually think that I err on the higher side. I think the tour was worth that amount plus the booking, but I also might’ve just paid a little more for a smaller group tour had I known that was what was expected or if we had been a larger party.",
320,Brilliant,"I thought my guide's name was Dominica but I cant remember for sure. Regardless, she was excellent and made a great impression.

323,Great Custom Tour,"This was simply not a good tour. The guide did not speak clear. Spoke very fast. He was Mexican and his accent and clarity was hard to follow and I am usually good with accents.

327,Amazing Tour in Barcelona,"Took 2 tours in Barcelona - Natalia (Gothic Quarter) and Mel (Gaudi architecture tour).

These ladies are so passionate, knowledgeable, engaging and patient to answer a plethora of questions from us curious tourists in Spain. The city is absolutely breathtakingly beautiful, myriad of histories, cultures and stunning architectural landscapes.

The free walking tours are a great way to visit and learn about the history from locals who have studied and lived in Spain for several years. Natalia and Mel were both superb guides and were definitely highlight to discovering and learning of the history of Catalonia and Modernism (Art Nouveau) in Spain.

I loved Mel's attention to detail on the facades of the building - casa batllo, la familia sagrada, Casa Amatller, and her in-depth lecture of touches, finishes, materials and symbolism along with the accompanying historical trends of the century that Gaudi encountered in his life.

Natalia was extremely passionate and engaging - her stories were enriching, piquing curiosity from our group, and we enjoyed her coverage of several centuries historical movement in Spain from history of the Moors, Germans, French rivalries in early days of Spanish formation - Isabel and Ferdinand, Spanish Inquisition, the Black Death, Columbus's legacy, Industrial Revolution/Indianos and the wealth that Catalonia experienced, as well as push for independence and the many historical vicissitudes that deeply entrenched Barcelona's accomplishments and defeats.

Marta made sure to help us with suggestions and tips for the rest of our stay in Barcelona. She is also a great photographer ...the best family shots we have from the trip were the ones she took of us.,

A very engaging and knowledgeable lady, we will try and fit in another of her walks!",

346,Fun way to see area with dark past,"I've been doing tours with Sandemans in many different cities for over 3 years now and had had amazing experiences everywhere but Barcelona

It started with the option of paying for securing the reservation that I had never seen before, we didn't pay.

We arrived literally 3 minutes late and were told the tour had gone (first time I see one so punctual, but ok). But when I asked where I should go to catch the tour as they couldn't be far, another guide told me the tour was full

I showed my reservation, he argued it was not a guaranteed one and, after I insisted he pointed me to the wrong direction

I missed the tour and my morning. And learned tourists only matter for them when they don't have enough",
347,Private Four Hour Tour,"We took the Gaudí and Modernism tour with Javier. We can say that, among many tours with Sandeman, this was one of the best! Javier gave lots of details about the buildings, told many stories about Barcelona, Gaudí and other personalities of the time, and managed to keep our attention with his friendliness, excellent communication skills and good humor. It is a great way to get to know what makes Barcelona special in a short time! Thanks Javi!",
348,A Great Walk in the Gothic Quarter,"My friends and I really enjoyed our walking tour of Barcelona. Our tour guide Augustina was very knowledgeable, kept the tour engaging, and gave great recommendations at the end of the tour. Thank you Augustina!",

350,Lovely,I went on the walking tour of Barcelona with some friends and it was fantastic! Andy Pitt really knew his stuff and made everything really fun. If I travel back to Barcelona I would certainly look at the other tours offered. This is my sixth sandemans tour and I would highly recommend!,
351,Overpriced,"My partner and I came to Barcelona and had the absolute honour of accompanying Leon on a walking tour of the city. A fountain of knowledge and a comedic historian, Leon brought us through Barcelona's wonderful streets with style and flare. A one in a million guide!",
352,The Roof Tour Makes The Difference,"Cannot over praise this company! Done a few tours in different cities and they never let down. Andrew Pitt was a great guide with plenty of giggles and choices of what we wanted to know more about. Covered the whole of the gothic quarters in the 2 hours and was set out so well couldn’t imagine anyone doing it better. Would definitely be worth a a good penny if it wasn’t just based on tips, so tip well! Will be back to see more of Barcelona and bring on more sandman tours",
353,A Lovely 45 Minute Stop,"Andy the tour guide was amazing, great banter, knew what he was talking about and was very informative. Had a bad start to our day with the transport and a few let downs with things we thought would be better. this tour very much saved the day!!! Because of this tour I am considering coming back to Barcelona again when I had almost written it off.",
354,A haven of peace in the middle of possibly the most popular tourist area of Barcelona,"In Baseball batting .500 is good; but in walking tours, NOT. My wife and I booked a Sandemans Gaudi and Modernism walking tour of Barcelona after a very successful Barcelona Gothic Quarter walking tour. We waited with another couple at the Apple Store as was directed. We waited. And we waited. The Spanish tour was ready to start… our guide still didn’t show. We weren’t allowed to tag along even though my wife who speaks fluent Spanish, would translate. We waited a bit longer and spied a PURPLE UMBRELLA across the street. They we’re doing the same tour- different operator. They had a small group and welcomed the four of us to join. We did. The Guide, Mel, was fabulous. Yep, I gave her and her tour operator 5 stars.

Where in god’s name was our guide? Why didn’t the Spanish tour guide call and find out for us? Geez, Sandemans you blew it. Thank goodness it was a FREE tour.

Get your act together Sandemans!",
355,Barcelona's second best finest building!,Andy provided us with a very informative and entertaining tour of Barcelona Gothic area. He actually got the participants to vote on what the tour would include. We actually ended up with a mix of topics including street art.,

He is knowledgeable and keeps it interesting with continuous engagement and anecdotes which paints a picture of the past.

Definitely recommend taking one of his tours!",

Because of the tour, we could enjoy exploring the city much deeper.
We highly recommend taking the tour with Andrew ! We had the best 2 hours!",
367,Breathtaking,"I do not know what I was thinking... I purchased this tour ( 3 tickets) in advance, and unfortunately got to the meeting point 10 minutes late due to traffic. The tour left and nobody would respond the calls to let u know where to join them. The numbers they provide go directly to voicemail. I tried emailing them, writing messages in instagram etc, nothing. I received a message back the next day asking me if I was able to find my tour guide ( how would I with no reliable contact number?), and when I requested a refund they never responded back again. I should have taken the free tour, they are great quality and at least u pay at the end of the tour so this does not happen to you. Terrible experience, terrible customer service",
368,Disappointing, Closed When Visiting,"Not according to legends, but according to the facts, Andrew was an excellent tour guide. I totally recommend the Gothic quarter tour."

370,Interesting Cathedral - Cover Your Shoulders,"Danny/Daniel was a really great tour guide. Very knowledgeable and so well prepared! He had print outs of certain paintings he referred to, and maps when he was explaining some of the history of Barcelona/Spain. We learned a huge amount about Barcelona. My partner and I thought it was one of the best tours we did on our trip, he was really fun and a great guide. A++ to Danny!",

Best thing to do on your first day in town,you get to see the best places!Paula was wonderful,seemed to have as much fun as we did! Learned a lot about the history of this beautiful city and she showed us so many wonderful places. Thank you Paula!!",
373,Lovely square with lively atmosphere,"I've done several Sandemans New Europe tours, including Barcelona, and they are great. Guides pay a small fee to the company per guest for the booking so you know your $$$ go directly to the guide based on how informative. This is an incentive to the guide and such tours are much better tours and vulue compared to regular tours.",

376,Montserrat from Barcelona,Miguel took us on this tour - he made every minute engaging - we loved his sense of humour and he kept us interested throughout the whole tour. The tour was very organised and as a small group of 4 all of us got more out of it that we were expecting and than we would have if we had toured the area alone. After the tour we went to one of the restaurants he recommended in Barcelonetta - which was wonderful. Thank you!!,
377,Excellent experience,Great tour with our guide Jarrod! Very knowledgable and very nice guy! I got a lot more out of the walk than I would have otherwise,
378,Brilliant (and fun!) in every way,"We did a private tour with Gemma as our guide. It was just the right duration and sights. Gemma was great and we stopped at a gourmet vegetarian restaurant which suited our needs. One person in our group was in a wheelchair and an aged couple, so they paced out the tour perfectly fitting all the must do places",
379,Best decision you'll make!,"Fernando gave us an excellent tour of Barcelona’s Gothic Quarter and Sagrada Familia, customized for my mobility restrictions. He is an excellent guide, charming, personable, and very knowledgeable about Catalan and Spanish history. We particularly enjoyed seeing Sagrada Familia with his expert commentary. I cannot recommend him and Runner Bean Tours highly enough.",
380,"Don't hesitate, just book it!",Very well organized and conducted. Guide (Miguel) was extremely knowledgeable and personable. Had great information to share and answered questions along the way. At the end he offered suggestions on local restaurants upon request.,
381,Perfect introduction to Barcelona for our family!,"This was our first international trip for our children (ages 7 & 9) and I wanted to make sure the history of Barcelona was accessible and exciting for them. When I saw that RunnerBean offered tours specifically for children, I reached out and booked several private tours. The tours exceeded our expectations! Our guides, Tati, Lisa & Ana-Marie were great at engaging our kids and taught us all a great deal about Catalan culture. I can't thank them enough for helping to make our trip a memorable one.

I highly recommend RunnerBean and would certainly book with them again if I get the chance to go back to Barcelona.",
382,"We went to Monserrat and had an amazing, educational experience because of Lydia.","Great tour with guide Albert. As a local historian, Albert provided great insights and hidden gems throughout the Gothic Quarter. You can tell he was passionate and knowledgeable about Barcelona. One of the best free walking tours I have taken. I would suggest he mentions Pont del Bisbe which is a bridge connecting two buildings. We passed by it and would like to know about its history. Overall a worthwhile tour and great value. Best to go with RunnerBean guide than on your own. Highly recommended.",
383,Comfortable and fun!,"We booked a private half day tour with Runner Bean Tours. I am so amazed at how professional and responsive the owners are. Gorka was so responsive to my queries and was able to customize our half day tour to cover the Sagrada Familia Gothic Quarter and Park Guell.

Our guide, Fernando is an excellent guide! He is also very humorous and we never had a dull moment during the tour because he kept us all engaged. His knowledge of the history of Barcelona is amazing!

If given the chance to go back, we would definitely book again with Runner Bean Tours!",
384,The best tour & guide we have had!,"Our party of five took a Gaudì tour with Tati in May. The tour was well run and the meet up spot was easy to find. Tati was very knowledgeable, friendly and answered any questions we had. The tour is free after a modest booking fee and then you pay her what you think she is worth. We really enjoyed the tour.",
385,A Superior Tour Guide Experience in Barcelona,"This was a great first activity in Barcelona. We stayed in the Gothic Quarter, so it was very helpful for the rest of the trip as well. Ann-Marie was a wonderful tour guide, and I loved listening to her speak about the history of the Gothic Quarter. Learned a lot, and it wasn’t too much walking with lots of short stops. Great tour!",
386,Forever Barcelona….The Inspiration and Magic of Gaudi.,A very nice way to spend 2.5 hours. Felt we got a great feel of the city and got much more history and views than we could have found on our own!

388,Best Gaudi tour,"I thought the tour was excellent. The tour guide was well informed, very personable and took us all around the Gothic Quarter. I learned a lot and it was fun.",
389,Amazing Montserrat and Sitges Family Tour,We joined our guide Miguel for this tour around the Gothic Area. Overall it was very informative and enjoyable. Some additional information as we walked passed various buildings would have been useful but I think that there was still enough information to make it worthwhile.,
390,Barcelona tour to remember,"Tati is a very knowledgeable and creative tour guide that gave us a deep understanding of the Catalonia history and Barcelona particularly to understand the background of the Gothic period of the city.
I highly recommend the Gothic tour for everyone who is interested in architecture, art and history of Barcelona.",

392,Excellent private tour of Sagrada Familia,"We took the Gothic walking tour today and really enjoyed it. The 2 1/2 hour tour was informative and fun. It was great to see the sites and hear about the history of the city. After the tour we went back and explored more on our own.
I highly recommend this!",
393,So glad we found Marta.,Really interesting tour around a beautiful part of the city. Jarrod was a great tour guide with lots of niche facts and a great sense of humour! I hope I can do the Gaudi tour next :),
394,More texture than Gaudi imagined!,"Would highly recommend this tour and especially Jarrod was fantastic! He was knowledgeable, friendly, interesting, and enthusiastic both about Barcelona and its history. Could not ask for a better guide! Jarrod also shared some of his favorite restaurants (all three we tried were fantastic) and he was super helpful on recommending other city highlights/transportation/tix etc. We enjoyed both the Gaudi tour and Gothic tour led by him! Thanks for two fabulous tours and meaningful overview of Barcelona!",
395,Monserrat and Gaudi - Incredible experiences,"Took Gothic Quarter tour with Jarrod. Great tour!

398,Foreverbarcelone Tours,Albert was an extraordinary tour guide. He combines abundant knowledge with truthfulness and a delightful personality which brings to life his tour. His use of old pictures and diagrams further elucidate what he is explaining and particularly enhances his presentation. His personal passion for sharing his knowledge and love of Barcelona shines through throughout his tour.,
399,Loved the private tour,"This was an excellent tour which provided a ton of historic information to add to the amazing sights we we’re seeing. You get a lot of information in a relatively small group setting, just 20 people. Plenty of time to ask questions.",

401,Devour Sweets Tour,"Gothic Quarter tour - Jarrod was fun, knowledgeable, friendly, articulate and - most importantly- cared passionately about the area. Absolutely the best experience of our city break in Barcelona. Your man deserved every last cent of that tip.",
402,The Best,"This was a superb introduction to this historic city and Spanish history. Guide Jarrod shared his passion for, and knowledge of Spain.. He explained the inportance many places most tourists just walk past. The tour was at an easy pace. It's wortg re-tracing the tour's steps to take time to savour Jarrod's stories.",
403,A must-do Barcelona experience,"Great tour of the Gothic quarter. Tatiana was very knowledgable and had excellent english. Our second Runner-bean tour, and even better than our first(the Gaudi tour). Highly recommend.",
404,Super informative and fun!,"Sara, guide, was informative and enthusiastic- had props and a little projector and involves the group!",
405,FUN,We took the Private Four Hour Tour from a cruise ship. Communication prior to the tour was great and we were met on time at the cruise terminal. Gemma our guide and the driver were both great. We had a drive to the mountain overlook and then Gemma led us on a walking tour through the old quarter. She let us move at our own pace and was very informative. We then went to Sagrada Familia with pre-purchased tickets and went right in. The inside is fantastic and should not be missed. Afterwards we were dropped back off at the cruise terminal. This was a great tour and we really enjoyed our day with Runner Bean.,
406,Do not book this tour,Albert was an excellent guide for the Gothic Quarter walking tour. He is an historian and his love for and knowledge of history was evident as he led us through the winding passageways. This is a must do when visiting Barcelona. Don't miss it and hope you get Albert as your guide!,
407,Amazing food tour,"9,838 reviews",
408,Highly Recommend,"It’s ok, and if you really have done everything else in Barcelona, then I suppose it’s worth a visit, but it really is expensive for what is just another cathedral. I found it to be quite dark and gloomy inside. I found it more impressive from the outside than the inside, other than that ridiculously placed advertisement. Be careful about what you wear too - you need to cover your shoulders. It was a hot day, and I was wearing a strappy summer jumpsuit, and didn’t have anything on me to cover my shoulders, but they did let you rent a scarf for €2. I’d say don’t bother paying to go in, just view it from the outside. It’s not worth the money. Unless you really have done everything else there is to do in Barcelona.",
409,Great tour with a great guide!,"If you haven't prebooked - as we hadn't - and there's a queue for the ticket office, go to the museum to the left where there is a ticket machine. We bought a basic ticket which allowed us to fast track and also enabled us to visit the roof. I have to say that the Cathedral isn't any different from many other gothic Catholic churches - dark and heavily gilded with some beautiful stained glass. We joined a small queue to go up in the lift to the roof. Only the workmen up there get to stand on the actual roof, visitors use walkways constructed from scaffolding and metal platforms. I felt a little wobbly when I first stepped out but quickly settled, however those with a true fear of heights should beware.",
410,Amazing!,"We came here because we were informed it was ""one of the best examples of gothic architecture in the world""... that's up to you to decide.

We had tickets for 12pm on Tuesday, May 24th, 2022. We estimated we would be here for about an hour and it was a little less than 45 minutes (but that was also with 2 toddlers in tow). Honestly, until I looked at pictures, I couldn't remember this church (but we also did a lot of churches while in Spain). But once I saw pictures, I remembered a bunch of stuff, but nothing about the history or anything of the church. My daughter liked climbing the itty bitty metal staircase in the middle-back of the room and both my kids LOVED looking at the water feature outside, with all the white geese swimming around.

It really is quite beautiful inside. The floors are uneven and there are stairs to enter the church so while mostly accessible once you're inside, it's not to get in.",
411,Excellent Guide,"Right in the heart of the old town part of Barcelona, in part against a Roman wall, it is well worth a visit. Very traditional thus in some ways a touch austere but anyone who enjoys places of (all) religions, their architecture and/or art will find this cathedral rewarding. The surroundings are well worth wandering around, too, with lots of little squares to explore down winding streets.",
412,Fun and interesting tour,"Second best architectural building in the city behind the Sagrada Familia of course! Very touristy as its in the centre of the Gothic quarter really but deffo worth the visit. Inside was lovely, really beautiful cathedral, lots of history and good photos. As part of the ticket you get to go up on the roof and see the city from up high and that was amazing to have a full 360* view of all the sights in the city, great for the good ol' panoramic photo opportunity!",
413,Excellent Tour by Local Guide,"This is described as 'Barcelona's Gothic gem, at the spiritual and physical heart of the city. The cloisters are listed as one of the best parts with orange and medlar trees, palm trees, a mossy green fountain and the thirteen geese kept as the cathedral's tradition to honour St Eulalia's life.
The reality is that the building is so affected by pollution it has to be systematically cleaned which no doubt costs a fortune. I managed to get a photo of the difference.

The interior compared to many other cathedrals we have visited on this tour lacks the wow factor but this is a typical situation where an ecclesiastical building is being held up as a tourist destination when in fact it is purely what it set out to be, a church of god.

The garden in the cloister looks bedraggled and in desperate need of water and as for the geese? I just felt sorry for them in their stone floor enclosure with no grass and only cabbage/lettuce leaves to remind them of what green food actually is and a dirty, smelly, equally green pond to swim around in. Sorry but I'm sure St Eulalia would agree with me, let these poor birds go free.",
414,Wonderful Intro to Barcelona!,Where does one start. There are many things to do in this location. First make sure you go to the cloisters. Ideally go latish. There are queues so timing is everything and the cloisters are genuinely superb and there are geese which occupy the central courtyard. I love geese. The history of the place is amazing and the architecture divine. We did this on a Saturday evening and it was quite delightful. The following day was Palm Sunday and the previous day a security guy had advised us how we could attend the Palm Sunday mass (which as a catholic i was happy to do. After all Palm Sunday in Spain.. it’s going to be full on) anyway instructed we went through the side door along with the rest of the congregation and attended the mass prior to the procession. Of course this was great and we were in the cathedral so got to see the interior in all its glory and in action as it were. Obviously we hung around and looked at the interior while preparation for the procession were underway. We then went outside and grabbed a spot close to the facade awaiting the Palm Sunday ceremony of the blessing of the Palms. The steps and square were thronged with thousands of locals (no tourists here) holding the most exquisite and complex palms. Then the cardinal and bishops commenced the ceremony at the main door and steps and then processed down the steps into the square sprinkling holy water while the crowds pressed forward to get closer often holding up their children who were stretching out with their Palms to get them blessed. This was a true unadulterated and genuine moment of devotion and this was real Barcelona when the residents took over for their celebration. I was so glad to be there and like I said when the Spanish and Catalans do this sort of thing it’s almost like stepping back hundreds of years except there is nothing contrived about this. Great church great history great atmosphere and a great experience. This is what travel is all about. An absolute five and a once in a lifetime experience,
415,Bianca the great!,"Beautiful Gothic cathedral- at the time of the visit- partially obscured by the Samsung flyer. Hope it's gone now.

You can wander around the church or better yet, you can go and do a guided tour. It's not expensive. And you get a better perspective with the guided tour. No need to prebook. At the time I went, I went from airport, to hotel to drop my luggage, right to the church and got my tickets there. We were only 4 in the tour at that time.

We went up the rooftop. Construction was going on. We had a great view of Barcelona. Don't know though if this view was better than that of the Sagrada Familia. I did not climb the latter because I just had knee surgery. Is the rooftop worth it? In my opinion, it is.

We learned the history of the geese that you find at the back of the cathedral in the courtyard. They were originally raised to be an alarm system better than dogs. But more importantly I found out about St. Eulalia to which the cathedral was dedicated to. She is reputedly buried in the crypt at the bottom of the cathedral.

Just an added fact. They do have restrooms but its a paid restroom. You have to drop a coin. I forgot if it was 50 cents or 1 euro. I don't mind the pay. The restrooms were quite clean.

There is quite a few notes/post comparing this Cathedral with the Basilica Sagrada de Familia. Having visited both and on a guided tour (minus climbing the Sagrada Familia towers) the Sagrada Familia is the more opulent of the two but the Cathedral has more spiritual history.

Both are worthy of a visit.

Oh, I forgot. There is a nice courtyard (if that is the right term) outside the main entrance of the Cathedral. Great place to hang around and listen to talented amateur musicians. Incidentally, if you are going to do a Gothic sector tour with Donkey Tours, their meeting place is about a minute walk away. We did this and was able to fill in our first day in Barcelona.",
416,Kids had a blast!,"9,838 reviews",
417,Just blend in. You wouldn’t have seen or experience this.,"Approaching, it was marvellous seeing the great Neo-Gothic façade. Truly impressive.

A wonderful interior has slender columns arching to the vaulted ceiling. A lovely choir has fine carved elements and retain the coats-of-arms of Knights of the Order of the Golden Fleece.

A tranquil cloister allowed for contemplative time, the silence only broken by the flock of geese that still reside here.
",
418,Amazing tour and experience,"A wonderful building slightly ruined at the moment by Samsung adverts around the scaffolding high up (I hope they got a fair wedge for this). Superb inside. Spend some time looking at the various side chapels. The roof visit is worth while for the inner city views. Do not miss the cloisters off to the side - it seemed totally devoid of visitors when we visited. A peaceful area to sit in the fresh air after the church. Nice to see the real Cathedral of Barcelona instead of the ""vision thing"" across the city!",
419,Perfect tour with Maria,The Barcelona Cathedral is located in the old city within the gates. It is famous for its remarkable gothic and Neo-gothic style architecture and one of the most important churches in Barcelona.,
420,Worth a try,"A gothic cathedral which does what it says on the tin. Lots of altar shrines in gold. It does have a great crypt chapel , gorgeous cloisters which 13 geece (!) and stunning views from the roof( worth the short queue with a lift up).",
421,Highly recommend,"We only did airport pick-up. Booking was simple.. just a couple of emails back and forth and we were all set. Ruslan, the driver, was waiting for us after we left baggage claim and got us to our hotel without incident.",
422,Great guide. Appreciated her thorough explanation of the history of the city.,"The architecture and history of the Cathedral makes this site a must. The only frustration was the poor experience with the audio-tour guide, which was difficult to follow and kept converting back to Spanish.",
423,Not as Advertised,"Unbelievable, so many years of history destroyed by having a big ugly advertisement of Samsung right in the middle of the roof.",
424,Not worth the cost,We booked our visit in advance for Tuesday. It was not crowded. The guided tour staff were kind and accepted us even after the time we should have arrived. The cathedral is stunning and the Tower of Passion offers great view of the city.,
425,Excellent tour with Pili,"Breathtaking. The architecture it amazing.
I loved learning about the history and spending time here.

427,Promises Unfulfilled,"The cathedral was under renovation when we visited and it was closed to the public during the time we were there. The area in front of the cathedral is quite lively. Be mindful of your surroundings; there are folks there who’ll approach you to have a picture taken with them and should you do so, will summarily demand 5€ or more per photo taken.",
428,Hannah in Barcelona was Fab!!,"A majestic church in the middle of the city's gothic district. Worth your time as much as the Sagrada Familia is, so definetely visit",
429,Food tour in Barcelona,The cathedral is just small and not impressive. I do not think it is worth visiting unless you can get to the top.,
430,Bike tour was excellent,Interesting gothic cathedral with Roman buildings next to it and a big square out front. Entrance was easy however it required the purchase of a shawl to cover bare shoulders in the summer (2E). Inside lots to see and wonder about. Def worth a visit if you're into architecture and the gothic styles.,
431,Wonderful introduction to the city!,"This majestic Gothic cathedral is the seat of the Archbishop of Barcelona. The cathedral was built from the thirteenth to the fifteenth century, and the main work was realized in the fourteenth study. At the end of the nineteenth century, a neo-Gothic façade was built over the nondescript appearance typical of Catalan churches. The roof is notable for its gargoyles; a variety of animals, both domestic and mythical, are found on the image.",
432,Excellent car service in Barcelona!,"This is a strange cathedral, and one more full of jail cells for chapels. The way the cathedral was built with a choir in the middle and a crypt underneath the altar with the entrance right before it is most cumbersome. It must be really weird attending services here specially if the cathedral is full and you have to sit on the sides. The cloisters are fenced off and full of geese. This looks more like a country church and not a big city cathedral. They charge you to use the toilets there after charging you €9.00 to come in. Not cool! there is a little museum here, and no photography allowed, but there is nothing interesting in there. The entry fee is high compared to other cathedrals in Madrid, Sevilla, Cordoba, and Valencia which have more to offer. If you are pressed for time, skip it you won’t miss anything.",
433,Top notch service,"Didn't go inside the cathedral & the Samsung phone advert on the scaffolding at the top is a bit inappropriate ! It's an attractive old cathedral in a nice square near our hotel Suizo that had a good atmosphere throughout our long weekend in Barcelona, on the Friday there was an antiques market taking place & as we walked through on the Saturday evening to walk up the Avenue Portal del Angel shopping street to Placa Catalonia there were lots of locals dancing the Sardana in circles with their own band outside the cathedral. It was lovely to see such an authentic Catalan dance & hear the music, we then sat outside a bar & had a drink, families were shopping, people selling light up fliers in the sky, a very pleasant place to be on a mild November evening. A lovely square to people watch in.",
434,Fantstic Service!,A cathedral that was big but not more impressive than many other Catholic churches we’ve seen. Expensive at €9 per person and tacky with the huge Samsung advertisements dominating the spires. Good enough to look from the outside.,
435,perfection!,9€ to visit the cathedrale is super expensive especially it is under renovation...samsung advertising on the facade and some works inside. Overpriced for the renovation time despite an amazing site,
436,"Excellent, reliable and dependable service","We visited the Cathedral without booking online in advance and had no delay in entry, so don’t hesitate to stop in without a reservation. Entry fee is quite high. Impressive interior. Kids will love the guard geese living at the back of the building. There is always something interesting going on in the large plaza in front (flea markets, buskers, kids chasing bubbles). Watch for characters in white makeup wanting to be friendly and have you take pictures of them. They will ask for money from you and can be quite aggressive.",

438,Book With Confidence!,"Had a fantastic trip to Montserrat with an amazing tour guide, Marta, who knew everything about the history of this beautiful natural area outside of Barcelona. A memorable experience learning about the geological and religious history of this magnificent place. She was a warm, kind and generous host who shared her wealth of knowledge about her Catalonian heritage. Highly recommended.",
439,Excellent service,"Miriam was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic. We learned a lot about Gaudi, architecture and Barcelona. We would highly recommend this tour.",
440,Terrific Car Service,"We spent three days with Marta on Forever Barcelona tours — the tapas/Sagrada Famiglia tour, the Montserrat/ lunch in Sitges tour, and the Boqueria/Gothic Quarter tour — and we had fun!!!! Forever Barcelona is a joyful, well-run company. Marta (who owns the company) took us around and really crafted the tours to suit our needs. This was a trip planned for my 87 yr old dad who could not walk long distances. We rented a mobility scooter for him so every tour needed to be fully accessible. They were and my dad was able to keep up even when we explored the crowded Boqueria and spent hours exploring the cobblestone streets of the Gothic Quarter.

I’ve been on tours all over the world and Forever Barcelona’s were some of the best. Marta is a great storyteller and her tours are full of history, culture, local knowledge, delicious food, laughter, and delight. Thank you Marta and Forever Barcelona!!!",
441,Wonderful experience in Barcelona,ForeverBarcelona was the best money we spent! We booked two tours -- an evening walking tour and a multi-stop tour a few days later to visit La Sagrada Familia and Park Guell. Marta was absolutely incredible and made the tours so fun and engaging for our big group (22 people). Roser was a gem to work with during booking and made everything so easy! I cannot recommend ForeverBarcelona enough!!,

444,Barcelona trip,"Marta, the owner of Forever Barcelona, took us on 3 tours last summer in Barcelona: A tapas tour, a Gaudi tour, and a walking tour of the old town. She made all the history come alive as she told us stories along the way. She was fun, spoke English very well, and I will always remember her when I think of Barcelona. Over many years of world traveling, I've only met one other guide of her caliber!

Marta was always on time, and while she had the engagement meticulously planned, she was skilled at pivoting when a member of our group of 6 had a specific interest. She coordinated our walks and transportation to accommodate the slowest walker in our group.

Marta is a kind and empathetic guide; she was sensitive to the preferences and physical fitness of our group.

Marta is AT LEAST 50% of the reason we loved Barcelona so much. We learned a lot, laughed a lot, and plan to call her next time we are there. We have recommended her to others!",

495,"Boring, uninformative, lousy audio","We had the BEST time in Barcelona, largely due to the two incredible tours that we had with Maria (""MJ""). We were staying in Barcelona for 2 nights after a cruise before our return home. On the first day we had booked a half day city tour and on the second day a 5 hour trip to Montserrat. Both were amazing! MJ was punctual, informative and so full of positive/incredible energy. Most importantly, she was very perceptive about our family and seamlessly adjusted the tour to fit our needs/interests. Our party of 6 consisted of my husband, our 2 children, my two parents (one with mobility issues due to a knee injury) and myself. MJ perfectly adjusted the tour to be slow enough for my mom to keep up and at the same time keep the interest of our kids. She was really able to keep all of us engaged which must have been a huge challenge (but you would have never known). She was continuously finding ways to make our time memorable (from finding fun ways to take a picture to stopping for local treats). She even went out of the way on our return trip from Montserrat so that my son could see/take a picture at Camp Nou (Barcelona Stadium) because she knew he had an interest (even though this was not part of our scheduled tour). Each day when MJ left us, she went out of her way to make sure that we had a good plan on how to utilize the remainder of our day in order to maximize our time in Barcelona. She is quite simply the best tour guide we have ever had. I also want to give a shout out to our driver Manuel. We felt incredibly safe riding around with him and he was always quick to add insight wherever he could. He was extremely friendly and very pleasant to spend the drive with.",

511,Good experience,"We took 2 half day tours with Forever Barcelona. Both were excellent. I highly recommend both. We did the Gaudi architectural tour with Begonia and she was great. She was very informed about Gaudi's life and architecture. Plus it was wonderful to skip every line during a very busy tourist season. Our second half day tour was with ""Maggie"" who was also a great guide. We love history and she had a great depth of knowledge to share with us as we went through the Gothic Quarter, El Born and the Picasso Museum.",

Please come back one day to see the progress in Sagrada Familia, I'll love to see you again!",
513,Sightseeing,"We just returned from an incredible half-day, private Gaudi tour. We were a party of 10 (including 4 teens) and had 2 mini vans shuttling us around which made it so easy. Also, all your tickets are purchased ahead of time and you don’t have to wait on any lines to enter once you arrive.

We learned so much from Marta - couldn’t have asked for a better guide! We visited Casa Mila, Park Guell and Sagrada Família. She really helped is appreciate all the details, history and insights that we would never have learned without her. Totally worth the extra cost to visit with a guide - makes it a completely different experience.",

519,So. Many. Pigeons.,"We met Adi in 2016 for a great Gothic Quarters tour. When we saw him on WithLocals, we were thrilled to book him for the food tour again now in 2023. He did not disappoint. We had a fabulous time trying all the foods. Come hungry and leave full. Very highly recommend any tour with Adi!",
520,"Nice Plaza, Lots of Statues","This was false advertising. It was not clear that it was a walking tour. I would never have booked a walking tour since I have limited mobility. When Denis arrived, I canceled the tour. It was obvious with my cane that I could not participate. He was nice and we have him 20 euros as a thank you for meeting us. Denis refused to give the refund, and took the almost $200 that we paid. I am very angry.",
521,Feels like the centre of Barcelona,"My friends & I travel a lot & frequently take tours. Our Market Tour with Sebastian was beyond our expectations. Sebastian was friendly, engaging, knowledgeable & adaptable. Our first tastings were cod 3 different ways, 2 days later we are still arguing over which preparation was better. He adjusted the tour based on our interests & brought up relevant local & historical knowledge of the area & the food. We left the tour full of food & with wonderful memories. We had a wonderful time & cannot wait to come back to Barcelona to tour more local food destinations with Sebastian.",

523,"Plaza de Catalunya, one of many beautiful plazas in Barcelona!","It was a rocky start, as 2 other guides were unable to do the tour with us and we also needed to cut the tour by 30 minutes due to travel time. Tomas was accommodating to the time change and gave us a good tour of Barcelona.",
524,Monumental,"Ellie provided a ton of information about Guadi in her tour and kept things interesting. She went into great detail about his architectural style, philosophy and life story. Additional photos and references on her iPad filled in more info. She even helped with some local restaurant recommendations. She was super friendly and personable and we enjoyed every minute of our tour. I highly recommend this tour and Ellie as guide. The 3 hours flew by!",
525,Big open square.......,Wonderful tour of old Barcelona that covered the history from Rome to present day. Our guide was Lluis and he was extremely knowledgeable of the old history of the town as well as more recent events. I very much enjoyed his insight and commentary.,
526,Plaza de Catalunya,"It is a great chance to walk through different parts of the city and sample the (delicious) local cuisine. Our guide, Krisztina, was great, and an interesting person as well. We did it at 6:30PM (the latest) so it did for dinner (lots of food).",

She knows the city - Gaudi - Sagrada Familia and the way to convey the most important aspects of the city in a reasonable amount of time. The nuances of our tour gave a super feeling that we were getting all the highlights of Barcelona. I would highly recommend Ellie and the tour she provides. Well worth the time and money.",

He was very kind, engaging and informative. We loved the fact that we were able to “co-create” (construct the experience) and he was very responsive to our ideas. Whilst he introduced us to the most important historic, cultural, architectural concepts, we got to eat the best pinchos and churros. Highly recommended if you want to make a memorable experience with your teenagers!",
533,Barcelona's main square,What a great tour with Sebastian. He mixed in some history with the great eats and did an excellent job entertaining and engaging my kids. Would highly recommend him as a guide and we thought this tour was great.,
534,Wonderful Square in the heart of Barcelona,Kriztina was an excellent guide. We went to places we would not have known about if we had not done done this tour. We enjoyed great food and great company. Highly recommend this as a unique way to experience the city.,

No vermut or patatas bravas (as advertised). We stopped for coffee and WE paid for it (including his). For this we paid $80 EACH. Don't expect help from the company, we tried.",

543,Lovely Square in heart of Barcelona filled by Gorgeous people !!!,"It was okay, but I didn't think it was close to worth what it cost. What it cost for two people was almost $300. I booked it with Trip Advisor for a price of 245 not sure if that was Euros or dollars. My credit card was compromised so I had to get another one. I went on Trip advisor and put the new card in, but I still got a notice that I was cancelled for nonpayment. I booked it again--this time the price 264 with Viator but actual cost was $287.
The ""group"" was me and my granddaughter. It's more fun if there actually is a group, but can't blame the vendor for that. The first taste was to a chocolate shop where they were handing out free samples to anyone who came in the door. THen we went to another chocolate shop where we had a chirro, which we dipped in chocolate and whip cream. Good. Now we've had 4 of our 10 tastes. On to the market where we had an empanada and a juice drink. We walked on, went to the top of a hotel to look over the city, and finally to a small local market where we each chose 3 tapas, had wine, and brava potatoes. So, technically, that was ten tastes, but I've done other tastings that were much better. The food was fine. I've been to places where you were shown how the food was prepared or told something of the culture or the ingredients. THe guide did talk about Barcelona generally. It wasn't terrible, but I also don't feel it is worth what it cost.",

546,Fantastic time!,Pili is an incredible guide who kept us focused and fascinated for two hours while talking about Gaudi’s work. She’s a glass artist herself and could explain how Gaudi’s research of light waves was crucial to his work. We learned so much! Her own work is presented on the top of one of the towers in f la Sagrada familia. A true pleasure!,
547,Great Tapas Tour,We had a great time with Octavio! He took us to 2 great spots for drinks and tapas! We had such wonderful conversation and learned a lot about Barcelona’s history and politics! He also gave us suggestions for lunch upon our return to Barcelona before flying home and that place was unbelievable~ to the wine and the food!!! Definitely was worth it and we made a friend in the process! 😊,
548,The tapas were great but Brais was better!,"I thought this would be a great way to start our vacation, even at the price. WRONG. We walked the streets of the Gothic Quarter around and around, passing the same streets over and over again, and that was it. We finally called it quits. My advice if you decide to book a tour - get real specific with your guide before booking, bring a copy of your conversations so you and your guide understand what needs to be done.",

551,Two Thumbs Up,We had the best time with Hanna showing us the beautiful city of Barcelona! She was so easy to chat with and shared all the interesting stories behind the history of the city! We asked tons of questions and she had the answers to all of them. A delightful day indeed!,
552,Great tour- would highly recommend,Ilona was a great guide! She was charming and knowledgeable about the Barcelona food scene. Fabulous food experience! Highly recommend!,
553,Barcelona food tour,"We booked with Marina to show us around the city and get our bearings. She was wonderful and took us in the first 1.5 hours to everything around our hotel. Helped us buy bus passes and SIM cards, showed us where to shop and even some Roman ruins. I would highly recommend her as a tour guide and as someone to answer all your questions!",
554,Food Lovers tour with Brais,"We messaged Roman a few days ahead of travel to Barcelona and he responded very quickly to say he could meet us at the airport. We were a group of five so we confirmed that he'd have enough room for us and for our luggage. He said no problem and gave us a quote upfront and confirmed that he could take credit cards.

Our flight ended up being 4.5 hours delayed getting out of North America so by the time we reached Barcelona, the customs agents weren't expecting such a large group and so we ended up being several hours later than we had originally planned.

We let Roman know what was happening and he told us it was no problem and he'd make sure we had a car and a driver for when we arrived. He and Tony were waiting to meet us as soon as we walked through the airport exit. Such a relief after a long trip.

We liked Roman and his team so much, we ended up using them 2 more times over the course of our trip. And if we go back to Barcelona, we will absolutely call Roman again. Highly recommend!",
555,A great way to meet people and share tapas!,"Our flight from Canada was delayed for 10 hours and they had no problem accommodating us for the airport transfer to hotel. We also had them for a day of city tour and finally a transfer from hotel to the cruise port. They exceeded all of my expectations in every category, highly recommended.",
556,Brais is the Best!,"Roman was wonderful to work with - we used him and his drivers for airport transfers and also for a pickup from Costa Brava into Barcelona. They were courteous and on time, and communication was great",
557,Barcelona tapas tour,"We used Roman to set up an early transfer from our cruise ship to the airport. because we had a tight connection, we needed speed and peace of mind in our transfer. Roman was super easy to set up our ride with, confirmed it a few days earlier, and was prompt and professional. in short, perfect! I highly recommend him to anyone when in Barcelona!",
558,Such a fun time!!,"I chose this limo service after reading a few reviews and I was not disappointed. My travel group had 14 members with varying arrival days and times. Roman, Waqas and Guillermo were all very cordial and professional. On the first day, I arrived at BCN on schedule and then needed to wait an hour for 4 more members to arrive. Waqas was on time with my name on his iPad waiting in the designated waiting area. We ended up waiting an hour for the group to come out as the luggage was held up inside the airport.
On the second day, a total of 8 passengers were supposed to arrive on the same flight and get picked up by Guillermo. At the last minute, the flight got delayed over 5 hours. 3 of the 8 people rerouted and came in early and Roman sprung into action and was able to pick them up. The other 5 passengers, though 5 hours late, were picked up by Guillermo.
Guillermo was prompt and on schedule for our drop off to the cruise port the next day and When we came back a week later, despite not reaching out during the week as I did not have WiFi connection, we contacted Roman from the port and Guillermo was able to transfer us to the airport on time to catch our flight home. I highly recommend them and will definitely use them the next time I go back to Barcelona.",
559,Very first food tour,"After booking with Roman back in 2016 we returned for May 2023 trip given the excellent experience. Roman and his team did not disappoint! They were able to easily and professionally handled all 6 of us including a mobility limited 82 yr old and all 12 pieces of luggage. First off, David was patiently waiting for us outside of the luggage area with a clear signboard and swooped us right up, out to the van, loaded us and our bags quickly and right to our rental apartments. David was kind enough to help roll our bags down the street to our apartments entrance. The next day Roman was our driver/guide on a visit to the Penedes region. We first went to the Gramona Winery for their standard tour reserved with the assistance of Roman. Along the way Roman explained many sights and the terrain. After the winery we headed to a local restaurant for some traditional Catalan food. Then back to our apartments. The next day Roman was our driver to our cruise ship. Knowing that our bags would not all fit in his van Roman made arrangements for his son to follow us in their personal car to car some of the bags. A quick and seamless delivery to the port. The following Saturday Kevin and as patiently waiting for us at the port with a clear signboard, working with the porters he negotiated pulling right up to the curb to load us and our bags. Kevin quickly delivered us to our hotel on the Las Ramblas for a one night stay. Sunday Kevin picked us up, loaded all our bags and delivered us promptly to the airport. He was kind enough to drop us off at the handicap drop off and even call for a call chair.

I would not even consider looking for another personal and professional car service in Barcelona. We have been and remained impressed and extremely satisfied with the services provided by Roman and his team!!! A big thanks ton Roman, David & Kevin!!!

If you are ever",
560,Delicious food in a great city. Ask for tour guide Jessica,"We booked (3) transfers and each was perfect! We had a transfer from the airport to a hotel; hotel to cruise port; and cruise port to airport. Drivers were easy to find with family name sign; all transfers were on time; communication during booking and leading up to services was thorough and detailed; vehicle clean with plenty of room; and most important, the drivers delivered us to our destinations safely!

Book with 100% confidence! Thank you to Roman and his team!",
561,Great time with a great guide!,"We used this service recently for airport transfers and to get to/from a concert at Estadi Olimpic. Service was excellent and the vehicle was modern and immaculate. Our driver, Kevin, was very professional, but more importantly he was extremely friendly and helpful. He recommended places to eat and provided a lot of interesting information on different landmarks as we passed by; it felt like being driven around the city by a good friend instead of just a hired driver. I would definitely use this service when we visit Barcelona in the future!",
562,Lovely experience,"We just returned from a family trip to Barcelona on which Roman picked us up at the airport and took us to our hotel, and dropped us back to the airport at the end of our trip. What a great experience! Exhausted from an 11 hour flight, we were grateful that we booked Roman. He is really nice, warm, professional and easygoing. The ride was clean and comfortable and we enjoyed speaking to him about the city. I would definitely book him on any future trip to Barcelona.",

574,Amazing experience,"What a wonderful cooking experience! We first toured Boqueria Market to see all the goodies, and make purchases for our class. Then back at the kitchen we made a delicious meal of Strawberry Gazpacho, Pan con Tomato, Spanish Tortilla, Seafood Paella, and Creme Catalan. All accompanied by a lovely light wine. Our chef, Renata, was a wonderful instructor. She shared her experience, without intimidating less experienced chefs. A definite must for couples, friends, or families.",
575,Awesome day with JB and Barcelona Excursions!,If I could give Roman 6 stars I would. We were moving our daughter back to the states after 4 months abroad and had a lot of bags to bring to the airport for a 6am flight. Roman answered my inquiry query quickly and communicated throughout the booking process. He was right on time 3:30am and the van was clean and he was open to talking about our experiences touring the city and offering his perspective. Just an overall great experience and a tremendous value given the peace of mind.,

He met us easily in the airport, safely and comfortably transported to hotel and then picked us the next morning to transport to cruise terminal. He even did an earlier trip in the day to pick up my sister and her husband. Although everything is super close, it was so easy to have Roman pick us up and help handle all the luggage. I didn't mind paying a little extra for the guaranteed service and the timeliness. There was no stress in worrying over transportation. We clearly communicated via email for scheduling and he was so helpful in answering my questions. Payment was easy. Highly recommend him and we will most definitely be utilizing his services again if/when Barcelona is on our itinerary. Vehicle was spotless, driving was safe, communication was easy and he even gave us a tour while driving.",

Our family, at the end of our trip around several countries in Europe, all said that our Barcelona eBike tour with Agata was their favorite! It was that fun and cool. If we return to Barcelona, first thing we would do is book another tour with her.",

Immediately, you'll know that you've made the right choice. Communication is the key to success & Roman's pre-arrival e-mails cover every question you might have about what to do upon arrival to BCN El Pratt & how simple it is to contact your driver. Start your trip flawlessly & without apprehension, especially if you're new to the area. Roman's staff is friendly & filled with local experience & information that they share openly with their clients so that they can confidently explore the area on their own & at their own pace.

We felt very safe and comfortable that we had booked this company to meet and greet us at the airport in Barcelona and transfer us to our hotel. A beautiful new vehicle also for our transportation .

We had visited Barcelona before so we didn’t need to book tours but if you do this is the company to use.

617,Wonderful tour!,"7,330 reviews",
618,You will love this tour!,"Teo was everything and more in terms of a tour guide. Gracious, patient, entertaining and always the consummate professional.
Would not hesitate to recommend this org or Teo for a fun filled tour.",
619,A unique alternative to the bus tours,Guide did not show much interest in explaining in detail during the tour. We were given brief overview and left on our own to explore. given the language barrier it was challenging to figure out in our own.,
620,Fabulous way to see Barcelona,"Shima was an amazing guide for this tour to Girona and Costa Brava! She was extremely knowledgeable, friendly, and educated in the Catalan culture, which she helped us understand. She took us through beautiful historic streets and alleyways, and she tailored the tour specifically to us. I would highly recommend this tour. We will have lasting memories from this day.",
621,A absolute must if you're new to Barcelona!,Very knowledgeable tour guide. I think her name was Marseille. Very strong accent. Sometimes difficult to understand. Bit more walking than expected. Pace was ok. Recommend for anyone who wants to know the history of the old town. We enjoyed the cable car ride and the Montjuic Castle. The view of Barcelona was magnificent,
622,Great way to see sights in Barcelona,"Montse was great! She knows all the ins and outs of the city, and shared the city's history (made it fun and not boring)! After the tour she shared links to restaurants and other activities!",
623,Big Fun!,We spend a great time with a small group of new friends visiting fantastic places in Barcelona.Our guide Alberto answered to all our questions and added a lot of stories and anectodes.,
624,Good way to see the city,"I booked this tour for my in laws who stated the following:

We were sent an email confirming our tour was at 10 AM with Miguel. When we arrived our tour guide was not there to meet us. I called him, and then he stated that he thought the the tour was at 12 pm. Another tour guide from the same company happened to be there and she said we could join her tour which we did. She did give us a nice tour, however she did not want to guide us back to the where the tour originated. This would have meant we would have to find our way back and buy train tickets which was not stated in the tour guidelines. She reluctantly assisted us and the rest of our group to return.

Overall, it was not an enjoyable experience as we had booked this in advance to avoid this kind of unprofessional behavior.",
625,"Great day, super easy to pedal through town","All the places - Sagrada Famillia, Montjuïc, Park Güell, and the Gothic in old town are magnificent and worth to visit. We are so lucky to have Omid as our tourist guide. He shared with us not only the physical beauty of the structures of these places as well as the history behind.",
626,Fun e-bike tour followed by good wine and tapas,The pace of the tour was perfect. Teo was funny and engaging and very knowledgeable. The time on our own was very nice. I learned a lot and got to meet some new friends.,

628,Make Time for This Experience!,"This is the second tour with Reuben. He has great knowledge, easy to be with and keeps us entertained. We will ask for Reuben again when we return to Spain.",
629,Barcelona Cooking on La Rambla,"Omid was a great tour guide, we were late at the meeting point, but he made sure that we could joint the tour. He actually gaves the beginning of the tour at the end. I would recommend Omid to any of my friends.",
630,Fun cooking class!,Our guide Daniela was absolutely phenomenal. She was very knowledgeable and made sure to show us the majority of the city all in one day. Her expertise made the experience very worthwhile and I would highly recommend booking such a private tour to get to experience Barcelona on a closer level. With this tour you not only get a guide but also the recommendations of a local that shows you authentic restaurants and let’s you know of all the hidden gems.,
631,10/10 Experience in Barcelona!!,"Ramon was a wonderful guide for Montserrat! He is knowledgeable, personable and fun! Our family loved our tour! Thanks Ramon!",
632,Yum!,Amazing way to see Barcelona in one day. Alberto our guide is fantastic and knowledgeable in all aspects of his job. Best tour guide ever.,
633,Fully Recommended!!,"I booked this tour for the first day of my trip and it was such an amazing experience! Teo was our tour guide and the day started off with pick up at our hotel and a tour all around Barcelona from the highest point in the city to the beach to the Gothic Quarter. Then we headed over to La Sagrada Familia for a tour and lunch on our own. We ended with a visit to Montserrat. Everything was beautiful with gorgeous views and lots of opportunities for pictures. Teo was an amazing tour guide. He is very knowledgeable, friendly, and funny. It made for a wonderful experience. I’d highly recommend this tour to anybody visiting Barcelona.",
634,Fun time cooking in Barcelona.,"This was a fabulous trip. Educational and fun. Gaspar was a terrific tour guide. Very professional, respectful and knowledgeable about Dali as well as Catalonia and Gerona. We live in St Petersburg, FL known for it’s “Dali Museum” so it was very important for us to learn more about Dali during our short stay in Barcelona. We would definitely request Gaspar to be our guide for any tours commencing in Barcelona.",
635,Delicious and memorable,"Omid was a great tour guide
He was knowledgeable, helpful and likeable
The tour was well organized
Highly recommend
Possible addition could be optional entrance to the sagrada tower
Really enjoyed the tour and the educational content
Loved the range of culture, history, politics, pop culture woven into the tour to give perspective to the artistery
Well done!",
636,Well Worth It!!,"Miquel was great! Very knowledgeable of all the sites, and a very safe driver. Besides the tour he would tell us about the history of Catalunya, where to go shopping, or find a delicious meal, gelato, local delicacies, and was a great jokester with us all.",
637,Fantastic day in Barcelona - Tour of Boqueria market and cooking class with Juan,"Great experience, Manu is a coolest and relax guide, he takes the time to explain important details and the freedom to explore the places. Best tour option for Girona and Costa Brava.",
638,Just un pleasure!,"7,330 reviews",
639,What a great time!,Montse shared a lot of great history. Her love of the city and it’s history showed in her passionate dialogue. Views from Montjuic are breathtaking.,
640,Great experience for all!,Amazing! Montse was very knowledgeable. She is excited to show off the city with lots of historical facts!,
641,Highlight of our trip to Barcelona,"Our day trip was amazing. Luis is such a friendly and funny person, he made everybody laugh all the way. He showed us places in only one day that if you would go by yourself you might need two-three days or so for it. Plus, you are not only visiting those beautiful places but Luis explaines the history of it too and he makes you trying food as well. It was a really good experience, I recommend 100% to do this.
In our group were couples and singles. I find this a nice way to meet people also.
",
642,Excellent activity to do in Barcelona,An outstanding trip! Highly recommend as a must see where visiting the Barcelona area along with the Sagrada Familia. Vincente was our guide and he is wonderful so knowledgeable and personable. Note as you get closer to the mountain the road is very steep and curved so be wear if you have motion sickness issues. But don’t let this deter you from visiting this magnificent place just be prepared it’s worth the effort.,
643,Best Paella in town,Extremely informative and just the right amount of time to see the highlights. If you want to see all and shop and eat may not be tour for you. Perfect for us.,
644,Need to be more careful with handling food and cleanliness,"Omid was perfecto. I am very glad we chose this tour. We also made new friends which is a bonus. Can’t fault this tour, everything was excellent.

Rob & Margrett",
645,"We met as strangers, we left as friends!","The tour felt amazing the moment Eduard picked me up. He was very nice and friendly, he was engaging throughout the entire drive there. Montserrat was very beautiful and breathtaking - so glad I booked the tour! Eduard was very passionate in explaining the history behind the landmark and Catalan history in general. He was very helpful and genuinely wanted to make the tour and our time in Barcelona as amazing as possible. Definitely would love to take another tour with Eduard in the city next time!",
646,Amazing culinary experience!,"Excellent tour, absolutely recommend for everyone! Valentina was amazing, very knowledgeable and fun! We had crash course on Barcelona history and enjoyed wonderful views from Montjuic cable car and top of the mountain, fell in love with Barcelona and Catalonia! In spite of us being late due to delayed flight we still had a great tour, communication was superb! Thank you, Valentina!",
647,A delicious home made dinner,"Valentina was a fabulous & a very knowledgeable tour guide. Stunning views of Barcelona offered on this tour. Would highly recommend, lovely way to spend the day!",
648,Cooking in Barcelona,Antaoli was a wonderful guide. Ride was comfortable and safe and his instructions were clear and easy to understand. I loved the museum and how he was succinct and showed you the best stuff and saved a ton of time. Highly recommend!,

650,A Masterful & Fun Teacher!,"We got off at stop 3 green route and walked along the sea front until we didn’t feel we could walk any further and went to join at green 8 only to discover a sign saying it’s not in use and nearest is stop 6 which was a long walk back. Somebody should say that 7, 8 and 9 are not in use. It felt like we weren’t getting the hop on:off service we payed for.",
651,Outstanding cooking experience,"The bus route was good as it covered lots of the city. The drivers seemed cautious and responsible. However, on one of my rides, the young female employee could not keep her mouth shut. She sat in the seat closest to the driver (which, of course, denied any of its riders that premier seat) and talked incessantly to him. I commend him for not engaging with her. But how is it this company does such a poor job of training its employees in basic safety measures?
On another of their buses the audio was out briefly. There was much ado about this by a different young female employee who was on the phone a lot with her office and complaining to the bus driver. Fortunately the audio returned. However, this young woman continued to voice her frustration on the phone and with the driver and forewarn incoming passengers with such a loud voice, that she made it impossible for those close to her to understand the audio! Rather ironic. I finally spoke to her about lowering her voice, and she did. Again, how is it this company does such a poor job of training its employees? These two women were very unprofessional. I blame that on poor training.",
652,"""Great time, don't miss out on this one""","The Hop On Hop Off bus was a great way to see many attractions in a busy city.
I try to use these tours whenever I can because you really see a lot of interesting things",
653,So much fun!,"Good for a quick visit if you are in the La Ramblas area. Nothing special but beware of pigeon poop!! I witnessed people got pooped on their head by pigeons.
There are also a few people who painted their face white to take photos with people and ask for tips thereafter.",
654,Best cooking class ever,"Wifi poor, buses crowded at peak time, Android app did not work. Staff very polite and helpful. Nice routes",
655,Fun Class,"Totally worth it. I highly recommend! I didn’t use it to hop on and off but rode it to the end, both lines on both top and bottom. It’s May but a little rainy so dress warm. Bring something to drink with you. I did it two days I enjoyed it so much. For the price it covers so much of Barcelona, I would recommend starting out your trip this way. That way you can note where you want to stop later. Take videos so you can screenshot them for pics later, don’t risk taking blurry photos. Check out the pics I took FROM the bus from videos, not bad! Wish more towns had quality bus tours like this!",
656,Delicious and fun!,The view's were amazing and we took a lot of photo's from the roof top. Very convenient to see places,
657,"I have worked in Bay Area fine dining for 25 years, highly recommend.","Really enjoyed this tour, did both full routes. Definitely the best way to see lots of sights in Barcelona.
Excellent value.",
658,Wonderful stay and just 40 min to the airport,"
Audio sound quality was awful: Scratchy and almost impossible to understand, Content was like out of an encyclopedia. Totally not interesting. Orange line sites were dull with only a couple of exceptions not worth getting off to look around.",
659,Great side trip from Barcelona,"Excellent value and very informative narrating.
Clean buses and friendly, helpful staff. Would definitely recommend this service..",
660,Incredible views,"2,701 reviews",
661,A Barcelona Must-See,"I added the Catamaran feature and lost money because the schedule has a 4 hour gap in the afternoon which we were not aware of. We were unable to return at the layer departure and could but get a refund.

The bus tour was clean, timely and interesting.
We enjoyed it very much.",
662,"Monks continue to reside, since its 1025 foundation",We had a great time. Took both orange and green tour’s with a stop for lunch in between. A great full day.,
663,Must do day trip to heaven in the monutain,"Loved the commentary, loved the chance to see so much of the city and become so informed.
Unfortunately the driver on my red route bus was really rude to us before we got on.refusing to let the four people we had made friends with ( who were next in line) get on with us. Raised his voice saying ""are you going to stop talking, this is my job"". When we only asked if he had room for all of us.
Really made my daughter and I upset, he really was extremely rude!",
664,What an experience….!!!!,Excellent jam packed tour. Our tour guide Richard was great and the bus driver Antonio was also a good driver. Our group was 15 people which was a good size. Your bus was modern and very clean and even had a usb port to charger our phones which was very helpful (make sure you take your own lead) as we took so many amazing photos our phone batteries were dying. The day was very full on which is what we expected based on the fact we were visiting three amazing locations - we did however have free time at each place which was great. I would highly recommend this tour for people who are able to cope with a fast paced tour!,
665,Go for the day!! So much to do,Great way to see the beautiful sites of Barcelona. Would highly recommend so you don’t miss out seeing the sites,
666,Nice day trip from Barcelona,Fantastic tour. Well organised and defo worth doing! We done both tours around the city and loved both! X,
667,Stunning Montserrat,Great way of seeing all the landmarks in Barcelona. Well organised and easy to locate the different stoping points. Need a few more buses running but overall a good experience and would recommend.,
668,Beautiful Place to Visit, Worth a Full Day's Visit,Enjoyable way to see the city with good maps and regular service. Friendly team. Audio could be updated!
669,Don’t shop in their stores!!!,Have done these tours in several cities and always find them good value. It's a good way to find your bearings in a new city.,
670,Olaaaa barcelonaaaaaa,"Fantastic way to see a great (and large) city! Easy to find online and at the WTC cruise terminal. Buses ran every 15 minutes or so. Maps and ear pieces provided. The only important site not visited was Monserrat. Caution: a bit of an uphill walk to Park Guell (was sold out on arrival). Easy to use.

671,"thanking for those moments, to the Black Madonna","2,701 reviews",
672,Worth a visit,Very convenient and a super great way to see Barcelona when you are short on time. They covered almost all the iconic buildings in 2 hours. The staff was very helpful 👍,
673,"HEAVENLY VIEWS, LITERALLY","Easy to purchase tickets with smartphones. One day ti ket is good for 24 hours after you use the first ride, so you can start at noon one day then come back the next day before noon.",
674,A wonderful stop that is not to be missed,"We take these bus tours in every city. Great way to get a feel for size, layout, and key attractions.

Tip- there are 2 competing companies. And their routes differ. Both offer a ‘west’ and ‘east’ tour option. Each option is 2 hours. And longer depending on traffic.

I wish there was more commentary - and music apropos to the country!",
675,Great!,"Heart of Barcelona and where you get all..at the top of las ramblas strip..
Nice meeting spot and lot of good shops surrounding
If ever I get chance to be in Barcelona yes I love to go",
676,One of the best excursions from costas around Barcelona,Very good experience with the touristic trip. The staff is available for any information you need and suggestion.,
677,Fantastic Day Trip from Terrassa,Great way to see the entire city and get around town! Drivers were very good and informative and helpful.,
678,Great day trip from Barcelona,Very good experience and taking photos when possible and would definitely recommend to anyone and would definitely go on a red bus again.,
679,You can get there on your own - no need for a package deal,"We always try to get a 'hop on, hop off' bus tour as it helps us to familiarise ourselves with the area and gives us the option of getting around quicker.

This tour offers two routes around the main attractions of Barcelona. We used it extensively over the 48 hours we had tickets.",
680,Excellent visit - 31 May 2022,On whole it was good . If one sits inside the agent like to chat with the driver making it difficult to hear the audio. I had to ask for the chatter to stop. The recorded sound is much better inside than on the upper deck.,
681,Unmissable,"We choose to begin the trip and Stop 2 and ride the full orange route without hopping off. We exited for a short lunch break and the returned to the orange route to be close to a green route connection. All worked well. The sound was better than expected, and only rarely did traffic noise drown out the commentary. A good overview of the city visually and the commentary usually coordinated well with the sites alongside.",
682,Montserrat Amazing,"5,076 reviews",
683,Utter tourist trap,"Not sure you can review a square as if you are visiting Barcelona you are going to pass through it one way or the other. It connects so many places in this part of the city. None of the fountains had any water so people were walking through them. Instead of eating at one of the street level restaurants, suggest going to the 9th floor of the El Cortes Ingles Department store. Good food choice and terrific view.",
684,This needs a LOT of time!,"This iconic square separates the old part of the city (Ciutat Vella) and the Eixample. The busy square is the starting point for some of the main arteries of the city: Las Ramblas, Passeig de Gracia, Avenida del Portal de Angel, etc.

The square is surrounded by shopping centers (El Corte Ingles), shops, hotels, bars, and restaurants. The square is also the site of several stunning public sculptures and monuments representative of Noucentisme, Neo-Classicism, and different avant-garde movements.

Compared to our previous visits, we noticed that the number of pigeons has increased enormously.",
685,Views for days,"The main square in Barcelona, connecting the Old Town (Ciutat Vella) with the newer 20th century Eixample.
The history of the square goes back to the beginning of the 20th century, when a piece of land just outside the former city walls was converted into the current Plaza.",
686,Excellent day out from Barcelona,"We had never heard of this plaza or were trying to go here when we ended up here... amongst thousands of pigeons. We were flabbergasted, until we googled it later and found that this IS the park for the pigeons.

While were were watching the birds, a few guys were leaving and offered us their bags of remaining food (I have a picture of the bag but it's empty and I don't remember what was in there - was it actual bird seeds??). The food was gone pretty quickly but the birds still remained, trying to find any remaining food that may have somehow been missed. We had them land on us as well, even without trying to get them to do that.

Due to the number of birds, we weren't looking at too much else. I'm sure this is a beautiful plaza full of rich history but unfortunately, it may be overshadowed by pigeons. It is very close to some great shopping and Ciutadella Park, though, so it's very likely you'll end up nearby!",
687,A very nice sightseeing religious and touristical point,"We heard that this was an important plaza to visit, so off we went. I mean, it was lovely, but all the fountains were turned off and a bit chunk of it was cordoned off, so we didn’t get the full experience. If you’re not headed that way already there isn’t really that much there that you can’t see elsewhere in Barcelona (unless you are after those specific statues) but if you’re in the area, might as well swing through.",
688,Great Fun,"With interesting artworks and fountains, a visit is a must. Lots of shops and restaurants around the edge and tour bus stops.",
689,Rolling Around Barcelona,Beautiful place with all the doves. My daughter enjoyed it so much feeding the doves and running behind them. They come to eat to your hand. Excellent,
690,Lots of Fun!,"We're on a 13 month trip through East/South Europe, Central and South America. We're about 7 months into the trip, and this is the FIRST hotel with no wifi.  

What do I mean when I say 'no wifi?' Maybe I'm upset with the hotel for other reasons, or exaggerating? Nope - it's a fine hotel, great bathtub and hot water, exceptionally comfortable beds and body pillows. However, this is all for nill - because there's no wifi in the room.  

We got in last night after a 13 hour trek from Sardinia, and we were unable to even load Google. Alas, I do remote work, so we had to sit in the hallway with our door open in order to get a weak (weak) signal. I'm not sure I'm happy to pay 200+ euro a night to sit in the hallway.  

When I called reception the guy just said 'I don't know, it's not my fault, contact maintenance tomorrow' - that's 4 star service for you! ;)  

This morning we went down and asked to change rooms. We told the receptionist of the problem and she said sure we could change today. Replied we'd be back after lunch. Everything good, and a bad review avoided.  

However, when we got back another front desk clerk said she knows the wifi is bad, that higher floors and rooms to the side don't have wifi. But lower floors have better wifi. Great - let's change.. Ah, but there's a charge for the change - another 200 euro for a better room for 4 days. Huh?  

On hotel site they specify say wifi is available, (and in what 4 star hotel do you even have to ask these days) - then you put someone in a room that you KNOW has no wifi, when you balk - they want to charge another 200 euro to give guests larger room with internet? I don't care about a bigger room, I do care about getting my work done without sitting in the hallway - so comp the room or bring a wifi extender. or, you know - just fix it..  (sigh).

When I reviewed the booking sites this morning I now see there are a lot of complaints about this. So, my humble recommendation is to skip this hotel if you want do do 'futuristic' things like check email, browse the web, do work, make calls, research your trip, or watch media..

UPDATE:
After two nights of no wifi, and sitting in the hallway with pillows, they moved us to another 'exact' room (at our request), only this one is on a lower floor, is smaller, and has no bathtub. Essentially we were punished, the wifi was 'okay' during the day (9mb down), but now at night 1am - we can't even get 1mb down.

Out of multiple emails to the company and hotel, we got exactly ZERO response back from them. Having stayed at most of the bigger named hotels in more than 100 countries I've got to give this group one of the lowest, because this is such an easy problem to solve, and no customer service.",
691,5 stars without hesitation,"One of many lovely plazas in Barcelona. During this January the weather was exceptionally pleasant with temps close to the 60s and sunny almost every day. Catalunya is near the old parts of the City and is close to Las Ramblas, the Music Palace, El Cortes Ingles, the harbor, etc. We stayed in an apartment near this Plaza. Metro station under the plaza is accessible from every corner. We loved Barcelona and hope to come again!",
692,Segway Tour 2 hours (fantastic),"A monumental square, a gate to the Parc de Montjuic and the city. Unfortunately with the high volume of traffic it's not very enjoyable buy still worth a visit!",
693,Segway Barcelona!,"5,076 reviews",
694,So Much Fun - thank you Lounis!,"A nice square in the city center, a lot of pigeons. Not as beautiful as the square of Spain. There are bulidings in construction.",
695,Fun Tour,"Located at the top of the Rambla, is this huge square, (that is bit of a sun trap), ﻿with statues and monuments adorning its surrounds with a fountain as a centre piece. It is one of the stops for the hop on hop off tourists buses, as a result very very busy.",
696,Great Segway Tour!,"The square is known for the fact that 9 streets converge to it with rays, the beginning of the Rambla, the epicenter of significant city events. It is from here that many of the most popular tourist routes begin.",
697,A great way to experience Barcelona,"This is the central point of the city, and place for public gatherings during celebrations and protests. When we visited, it looked more like a pigeon haven as lots of birds were gathered there.",
698,Great Segway Experience,"It is the most centre point of Barcelona. It's a very beautiful square. The metro line, Hop On Hop Off and airport buses start from here. It also divides old and new Barcelona. Two famous streets La Rambla and Passeig de Gracias start from here. There a lot of hotels, shopping, bars and restaurants nearby. One can sit here for hours and watch the world go by.
Worth visiting...",
699,Great tour and Super Segway Route,By far the busiest part of Barcelona that we encountered! As it’s the base for all the train lines and buses into the centre we spent a lot of time navigating it. Be cautious of pickpockets as it gets very crowded and a lot of people will bump into you (intentionally or otherwise!),
700,Segways and Amaing tour in a beautiful day,Giant square. End of the Eixample area and beginning of Las Ramblas. Just stand in the middle and take it all in.,
701,Segway tour to montjuic,"A nice plaza which basically separates the new Barcelona from the old/historical one. It is very central to the city and several major avenues radiate from it, such as Las Ramblas or the Passeig de Gracias. Also there is a helpful Tourist office underground, the starting point for the Barcelona hop on busses and the metro.",
702,Perfect,"Plaza de Catalunya is the epicentre of Barcelona, or at least those areas of the city of interest to visitors. At the top end of Las Ramblas it connects several sections of the city together, l'Eixample, The Gothic Quarter and el Ravel are all neighbourhoods that border on this massive oval shaped square.

This proximity to so many other places make it a transportation hub. Several bus routes serving all districts of the city stop here. Underneath the square is a sprawling and busy Metro or subway station that serves four separate lines.

On the surface the plaza itself is a major attraction. There two several beautiful fountains at the northern edge that run all day and at night are illuminated. Numerous sculptures and statues surround the plaza and it’s large open central area that is popular with skateboarders, rollerbladers and the local pigeon population.

Several tourist operators have booths in and near the square including the popular hop on hop off buses. The building surrounding the square contain a few consulates and several high-end stores and a fair sized shopping mall the Centre Comercial el Triangle.

There are plenty of options to eat here as well. Numerous restaurants line the perimeter of the plaza many with patios. Some are local establishments, others North American franchises such as hard rock Café, KFC and 5 Guys Hamburgers.

Odds are any trip to Barcelona is going to include at least transiting through Plaza de Catalunya. If time permits though it is better to stop and take time to explore it rather than just pass through.",
703,Perfect tour and a guide too,"Plaza de Catalunya is Barcelona's main square and huge transport hub. It is set in the very city center and serves as the starting point for exploring the city.
North from it is the famous Passeig de Gracia Av with high end shops and Casa Batllo and Pedrera, while south from it is Rambla and Barro Gotico old town.
The square is always full of people (and pigeons), very live.",
704,Its the best!!!,"5,076 reviews",
705,Great tour and very friendly guide,"Visited this square whilst in Barcelona. Its a wonderful place to stop, take a breath and relax, whilst enjoying the hustle and bustle that can be Barcelona! It's also a major transport hub, from the underground, to hop on hop off buses!",
706,Awesome tour,Really nice square in Barcelona. Has lots of cafes and shops nearby. Nice to walk around and to do some sightseeing. Close to La Ramblas.,
707,Must Do experience,"This is a very small park with a whole lot of pigeons! The seagull enjoy swimming in the pool as well. As Barcelona parks go, this one isn’t a highlight. But it’s somewhat charming nonetheless.",
708,Segway and Barcelona not a great match,"Very beautiful and large square. The monuments very well reserved, i d like to have some info to understand the symbols. It is mostly the place to have as a begining for all the routes. It worth a lot to visit.",
709,Sedway tour barcelona,Huge square where you end up if you take the airport bus to the city. Our hotel was a short walk away so we came her during our walks around Barcelona. There are quite a few shops and restaurants here and the fountains are nice also.,
710,Fun - for everyone!,"The Plaza de Catalunya makes for a great daytime stop. Full of life and activity, you can grab the metro or go shopping at El Corte Ingles. I would avoid this area in the evening - it fills up with a mix of shady folks.",
711,Great tour! Must do!,"I’m torn leaving 3 stars. On the one hand, this was a very nice introductory tour for those unfamiliar with Catalan/Spanish gastronomy. A lot of basics were covered (jamón ibérico, tortilla, huevos estrellados, etc). The portions were generous and the restaurants were good, but could have been split more evenly (there was only one croqueta and a glass of cava at the first stop and way too much food at the third). Brian was a very nice tour guide, though I wish he would have discussed more deeply the traditions, origins, and landscape of Spanish/Catalan cuisine.

On the other hand, the website’s description of this tour is deeply misleading. This tour is described as being geared towards understanding/celebrating more elevated gastronomy and focusing on local/regional ingredients. As a family passionate about haute cuisine and always eager to taste off-the-beaten path places tourists would rarely venture to, we were excited for this tour.

Per the description: “Spoil your senses with our most exquisite tapas and wine pairing tour in Barcelona. It’s ideal for foodies wishing to explore the local cuisine and who want to enjoy their stay in Barcelona while having fun off the tourist track.”

The website also suggests that the tour is going to go to restaurants that I don’t think we visited (if we did, it wasn’t explained to us). The pictures show much more elaborated, avant-garde dishes.

Per the description: “At our second “Organic Tapas” stop we’ll continue enjoying tapas, with a focus of organic food and wines, a superb Little place recognized for its products labeled “Km 0” (produced less that 100km around), fresh, natural, local and so typical. The Third and final stop in a beauty. A high End retaurant we have selected for you. Winner of the best Young Catalan chef award, the last stop restaurant is a supreme and culminating moment on our food & wine tour in a must-see restaurant. You will enjoy tasty sophisticated small plates prepared just for us, including the best fresh local foods, seasonal meals and wine pairings. With no doubt a serious candidate for the Michelin Star and a true culinary adventure for foodies.”

Quite frankly, I don’t think the other two stops, though delicious, lived up to these descriptions.

The tour is also listed as having 7-8 different wine tastings (we tasted cava, vermouth, and two wines) — the reason for the two wines was not necessarily explained why those grapes, what about the region pairs with the food we are consuming, etc. Again, neither of these promises were met.

Again, Brian was a lovely tour guide, I genuinely think the company is at fault for our average experience. The company needs to either change the description to fit the tour, or change the tour to fit the description. In the future, we will be much more skeptical when choosing a food tour.",

781,Amazing experience!!,"Great way to see a lot of Barcelona. We were able to see a lot from the bike tour, but then there was the cable car up the mountain and the boat ride. It really was amazing to see it all. Some of our group hadn’t been on a Bike in years, but picked it up quickly. Make sure you get a bike that fits you. We had some issues with others in the big group. It’s was 13 of us, which seemed too large as we got separated a lot (especially with a couple that had wrong bike size and couldn’t ride well because of it). The electric part was easy to figure out and make the climbs so easy. I wish I could have gone all day on these bikes and just explored. Marco was a great guide and I would highly recommend",

Both casual in approach, but very informative and thoughtful in route - we were able to cover some of the key square, bike along the beach (which we weren't going to have time to see without this tour) and then see some of Gaudi's biggest contributions to Barcelona. The bikes were easy to use and our tour guide was great. Highly recommend to anyone visiting.",

We went on the trip using e-bikes however the city is pretty flat so there is no issue to take a regular bike, although after a few hours on a bike my bottom was a little sore! Unfortunately it was raining the day we went which at first was ok however towards the end of the tour it became a little too much as we started to get cold. We were supplied plastic puncho’s which helped a lot. Totally recommend this tour to get your bearings of Barcelona.",

797,Positive Personalized Paella Party,"We were only in Barcelona for the day (cruise port) and could not obtain tickets to the Gaudi sites so we opted for this tour which would take us to them and through parks and neighborhoods in a more personal way than on a tourist bus. The e-bikes were in excellent condition and made any inclines effortless. I had not been on a bike in 20+ years so I was a bit nervous but I had a blast. Our guide (Agatha?) was knowledgeable and enthusiastic and caring. We had time for photos at each stop, bottled water and helmets were provided and I highly recommend this tour.",

Renata was our tour guide (the market tour) and instructor for class and she’s incredible! She has so much knowledge of food and cooking techniques, I learned a lot throughout the class!! Not only do you learn a lot, you also eat A LOT! We secured food from the market to make our meal and while we were there you could buy your own snacks and we sampled a few items as well but the class also includes 2 appetizers, gazpacho, paella, and Catalan cream (similar to crème brûlée) for dessert. Endless amount of wine, great vibes, great space overlooking Las Ramblas, a great time all together.

Special shout out to Renata, she’s amazing :) !!!!",

Suitable for experienced and unexperienced cooks, and you can relax while others cook if needed :)
We’ll be back!!",

The food was phenomenal and the market trip was mind blowing - so many colors and people and tastes. This is so worth the money…. The first time I went we had Renata as an instructor.

We continuously work to create good experiences for our clients and we are sorry to hear that we missed the mark here. At our kitchens we take up food safety very seriously and we all have a strong commitment in making it a priority. Our staff is trained in safety procedures and they generally do a great job when it comes to ask the participants to wash their hands with soap throughout the class and even more after touching their smartphones, but sometimes things happen out of our control. We will keep working to make our process even more efficient. We hope to have the chance to cook with you again. Gracias. Emma",

826,Wine tasting at it's finest,"What a wonderful way to end our beautiful vacation in Beautiful Barcelona.
Juan greets you at the door with open arms and a welcoming smile.
The setting is both authentic and romantic as you overlook historical Las Ramblas in this second story kitchen
Immediately you are an integral part of preparing the delicious meal
A quick yet thorough hands on explanation and demonstration and the meal prep begins
A few bottles of wine later, a few stories shared by the guests, a room full of laughter and aromatic scents
And Voila’
You are dining on a delicious meal prepared by a group of individuals who met as strangers but departed as friends

A must do

Looking forward to visiting again",
827,Cliffs and Coves private tour,"As a family of 7 we did the Tapas cooking class. It was a fabulous experience for all. We met new people cooked delicious food and drank a lot of wine. Our instructor was great, she was easy to understand and explained everything. Even the none cookers were able to help. I would recommend this experience. The recipes were emailed to us to try at home.",

829,Nice district,We had an amazing time. The class was informative and fun. The chef was personable. Great opportunity to make friends. When in Barcelona make sure to check it out.,
830,Casual & Crowded,"We enjoyed this wonderful experience last night. The kitchen was very clean, well organized and the quality of the cooking ingredients was outstanding! Renata was very knowledgeable and had a warm and friendly personality. She was very helpful with any additional questions we had for her. If you enjoy cooking, I highly rate this company! They did a great job from start to finish! The food prepared was outstanding!",
831,Cool and casual,"This is an excellent travel experience! I highly recommend it! Chef Juan is not only excellent at his craft, he thoughtfully brings everyone into the activities!

It was a pleasure to have his expertise and guidance at the La Boqueria market (where we bought our fresh ingredients) and his knowledge, patience, and sense of humor during the cooking and eating portion of the class! Thank youChef Juan for being an amazing teacher and host!",
832,Must be explored......,"Informative tour of the market and a fabulous cooking class. Juan the chef was inspirational and very helpful in providing tips to cook in the Catalan tradition. We greatly enjoyed preparing and eating a Gazpacho (using strawberries - wonderful!) as well as the best tortilla I have ever had (though quite salty to my taste) and a superb seafood paella. Plus we enjoyed several glasses of very pleasant Rioja!
I thoroughly recommend this activity, even if you aren’t really a cook.",
833,Between the Basilica and Picasso,"What an amazing experience today, we spent four hours with Juan and 8 others from all over the world learning how to cook Catalonian style dishes. An amazing four course meal after an hour visit to one of the worlds largest markets ""La Boqueria"".
It was so much fun and must do if you are visiting Barcelona any time soon.",
834,Wander about,"So much fun! Juan was a wonderful, energetic and fully engaged teacher who seemed to thoroughly enjoy introducing us to the market and these classic recipes. Was a highlight of our trip. Highly recommend for couples, solos or families - everyone will have a great time and enjoy a delicious meal. We cannot wait to try the recipes at home!",
835,Another historic neighborhood,"Had an absolute blast and a delicious meal with the chef! He was so knowledgeable and friendly and make us feel so comfortable.
We made gazpacho, Spanish omelette, palla and Catalan creme and every dish was incredibly delicious!!!!!!
Got to help on every dish, amazing small group atmosphere.
They were also super accommodating on any dietary needs.
Couldn't recommend more!",
836,Beautiful old area,Super fun class. Juan was our instructor. He was pretty funny. People in the class were fun. The paella was really good and we can say we made it. Would highly recommend especially if you are a group. The wine flows freely.....making it even more fun. Just and FYI for those with mobility issues....the actual cooking studio is on the third floor.....dont think there was an elevator. Not hard for us but might be for some.....especially after the wine :D,
837,Off The Beaten Path,"Highly recommend this. Juan was amazing - knowledgeable and a great communicator. Whether you’re an avid home cook or hardly cook, there’s something here for you. The 4 hours may seem like a lot, but everything is perfectly paced. You’ll learn lots about the local market (Boqueria), its history, and where to buy specific products within. The kitchen space is light filled, and overlooks La Ramblas so you feel like you’re fully ensconced in the culture as you cook and eat.",
838,Many seedy people in the area,"Chef Juan is everything you hope, knowledgeable, professional, and fun! He teaches techniques so you can modify with your local ingredients. The food and wine paired with his ‘family’ experience will fulfill your soul. Don’t hesitate, this is an amazing experience!",

840,Cool area,"We stayed at the hotel next to the monastery our last night in Barcelona and drove from there 45 minutes to drop off our rental car and fly home. The hiking trails are great, the hotel restaurant was a beautiful setting with an arched stone ceiling. There are hordes of visitors at the monastery so it was nice to be there in the quiet of the evening once they were all gone!",
841,Walking on the afternoon,"Montserrat is beautiful! The view from the mountain is one to remember.
Of our many travels, it is the first time we saw rock formations like we we saw there.
You can also stay for the church service daily and plenty of places to eat at the location as well.
Well worth the short trip from Barcelona to see it.",
842,Born,Wonderful scenery if you take one of the paths further up into the mountains which offer breathtaking panoramas. The monastery is huge and offers incredible architecture.,
843,Great place for shopping and food,"We visited Montserrat as part of a large bus group from a cruise ship port call in Barcelona. Montserratt is about a one hour drive from Barcelona and largely on winding mountainous roads. Founded in the 11th century, this is a working monastery with about 80 monks. We were told to not speak to the monks if we saw them, hence our feeling that this was not what we were expecting. We enjoyed our visit, and were astounded at the age and size of this place. However, it was not what we were expecting. We were allowed to visit the cathedral during services to see the ""Black Madonna"" but other than the brother conducting the service we did not see monks. The brothers have turned this into a miuti-million dollar tourist attraction. The crowds were large. Parking is at a premium. Views are spectacular.",
844,Locals pay no mind,"Arriving on the first cable car in the clear blue sky morning gave superb vistas of the mountain and approaching Monastery, in stone not dissimilar to the background peaks.

It was marvellous visiting such a revered holy place. A lovely courtyard is surrounded by Abbey buildings. Great panoramas, upwards to the mountains and down to the valley, were memorable.

There was no queue delay in visiting the Black Madonna. Afterwards it was delightful to spend time in the great Basilica.
",
845,New exhibit,It was wonderful experience to visit there by train and cable car. Breathtaking views everywhere even if you do not enter the Abbey or the museum. You can spend hours just enjoying the views or hiking nearby. It should be placed as top must do activity if you visit Barcelona.,
846,Spending a Morning in El Born….,"From the train journey from Barcelona, to the funicular journey to the top, this experience is one not to miss. The brave amongst you might try the cable car journey instead. The Basilica is stunning and the views to die for. The audio guides are a must and visitors are advised to touch the Madonna’s right hand. We only did a small portion of one of the available tours. It would take days to complete them all. Energetic visitors could either walk or cycle to the top. An amazing experience.",
847,I like to stay in El Born.,"What an incredible place; take the train to the top of the mountain. We had a short visit and wish we had more time you could spend the whole day there. The cathedral was great, but it will close from 10:30am-noon (mass) and may not open again until 1:30 pm. Food and shopping are available along with local vendors on the strip.",
848,Gothico forever!,"We went on our own on the train from the Espanya station in Barcelona. It makes a very nice day trip. The natural setting is spectacular—much more impressive than I imagined based on photos. The two funiculars that run from the abbey are closed for the season, but there are still several hikes you can make with beautiful overlooks of the monastery and the valley far below.

The lines at the abbey were very confusing. It was not at all clear where to go if you wanted to visit, as there were a few separate queues, and we ended up in the wrong one more than once.

We did not realize that you can make reservations online for the boy’s choir and the black Madonna. Make a reservation for 12:15 for the Black Madonna, so you will finish in time for the choir performance at 1:00. There is no charge, but you need to make separate reservations for each on the official abbey website. Since it is off season, we were lucky to get in without reservations, but you should not count on this.

With regard to transportation: as several reviews have mentioned, it is very easy to get off one stop early if you are taking the cogwheel train instead of the cable car. They don’t always announce the stop! In fact, this happened to us. We accidentally got off at the “Aeri” station. It turned out well, because we then purchased tickets for the arial tram and enjoyed it very much. We went up on the aerial tram and came back on the cogwheel train. The only downside was the 30-40 minute wait to board the tram. I would definitely recommend not coming back on the aerial. It is on the second train stop, which means standing room only on the train back to Barcelona! Even if you take the aerial up, take the cogwheel train down. Sit on the right side for the best views.",
849,Interesting as always,"If someone asks what heaven looks like, Montserrat might be one of the places that is close to it - beautiful, peaceful, quiet, and panoramic. We went with a tour bus, so it was a lot easier, but there's also public transportation to get there as well, which is by train and a gondola up to Montserrat. It's a monastery and a school for choir boys, in which they have to live on campus. This place is where you can see Black Madonna, which is well respected and protected by Spaniards. When you're inside Montserrat, every corner is beautiful, every building is rich with ancient architecture, as if it were heaven. If God lives here, I think he probably feels comfortable!
If you are in Barcelona, don't miss this place, all you have to do is plan your trip well with time. Another stunning place.",

851,Old Area - Lots of interesting things,"We ventured here on a day tour coupled with a wine and tapas stop. The abbey and its surrounding area is beautiful. We arrived in the early morning when the clouds had not yet parted, so the abbey was hidden away from us for some time; however, as the clouds disappeared, the abbey impressed. We took advantage of a hike to the cross situated across from the abbey; though the hike was worth it, going there was mostly uphill, so definitely was a bit more strenuous than walking on a level path. It was well worth the hike though, as the views were spectacular. We also had a chance for a quick view into the abbey where we saw the Black Madonna and another mini-chapel. As it was a guided tour, the time allowed to visit was quite abbreviated. For those looking to visit, recommend taking the train, as it will give you more time to spend in this beautiful area.",
852,Great district to find good food,"Place is great but..

Don’t shop in their stores. Shop clerks are very rude, racist, very unfriendly and an professional. Those attendants ruined this trip for me.

Best to shop with the street vendors. Who are very friendly and nice.

We booked via getyourguide and got their early. There were few people when we got there.",
853,Beautiful old quarter- take a guided walking tour,"We arrived with organized group ...
It was foggy at the lowest part of mountain... so when we got over foggs it was unbelievable nice and seemed to be over clouds...
Super place and very nice organised .
Very beautiful place to take pictures...
Perfect",
854,Worth the wander,"spectacular location, excellent place to be and to pray, thanking for those moments
the Cami de l'Ave Maria offers the place to light a new candle, after the meeting with the Black Madonna

do not miss",
855,"it used to be awesome, now you must watch out for thiefs..","We came to Montserrat on an organised tour. Beautiful setting in the mountains, and well worth paying extra for the funicular to go even higher. Walking around the top was definitely the highlight with stunning views and a lot quieter than around the monastery!

We enjoyed visiting the abbey itself but once is probably enough - not as ornate as many other similar monasteries/churches and more modern than we were expecting (once you know the history you’ll understand why!), and the site in general felt very commercial - almost like a theme park with tons of gift shops, cafes and hotels. Feel like it would keep the sacred sentiment a bit more if it toned down on these things.",
856,A labyrinth,"As if there isn’t enough to do in Barcelona itself, it makes a great base for day trips in the surrounding region. One of these is to Abadia de Montserrat or Montserrat Abbey. There are numerous tour options available, or one can simply do it yourself as we did.

Take a metro (subway) to Plaça d'Espanya and then use the regional rail system R5 train to Montserrat. The metro and rail stations are connected by a tunnel, something we did not know then, so there is no need to go up and outside and cross the square, unless you want to see it. The trains depart one level below the subway.

The R5 runs every hour at quarter to the hour. Tickets including the trip up to the Abbey are 24 Euros return. And can be purchased from the vending machines there. They are easy to use and there is usually a helpful staff member to assist.

Be specific though that ticket covers the train there and the cable car up and down to the summit. The wording can be a bit confusing especially if you’re in a hurry. If you don’t want the cable car then you ride one more stop to and purchase tickets on the mountain train that goes up to the Abbey. Both offer spectacular views. We opted to take the train up and the cable car down to maximize the experience. The train trip from Barcelona is just under two hours. There are washrooms on the trains and as of time of writing masks were still required to be worn and this was enforced.

Once at the summit there are several things to do. You can visit the museum, stroll the Abbey grounds, and/or hike or take one of the two funiculars to various outlying spots. All offer spectacular views.

Unless you get there real early expect crowds, the place is popular. If you want to enter the Basilica to see the Black Madonna or hear the choir, expect a long line up or take one of the tours that include this with “skip the line”. Even without these there is more than enough to take up a whole day there, or even a couple of days if you have the time.

There is of course an over priced restaurant, coffee shop and gift shop if needed. There was also a small market set up on the day we were there, selling souvenirs, and local honey and other products.

When your tour is finally done, don’t forget to visit the small café Bar el Rincon at the train station for the cable car station. By this time, you’ve probably earned a cold drink.",
857,An OK place to wander,"I thought I had reviewed this side trip from Barcelona, but TA says I did not. Here is a quick overview of the stop.

It is about an hour or so from the city and easy to arrange with a number of providers in Barcelona. If you feel you have done all the great sights and stops in the city, this is one to put on your ""to do"" list. The trip out the the mountain is quite nice and the ride up the mountain is ""exciting"" in terms of the narrow roads and drop offs. There is a cable car option available. Once on site, the structures are impressive and the inside of the monastery is attractive. We saw the Black Modena from the main floor, but the line to get up to see it was over an hour. Far better use of your time is to visit the regional art museum--it is very good and has some outstanding pieces of art. There are some nice places to eat and drink on site. Expect big crowds and parking if you drive up the mountain is almost impossible. The vista views are excellent.

Bottom line: GO!",
