0,The overwhelming presence of Gaudi in Barcelona.,"This really is a must see when visiting Barcelona. As you walk up the steps from the station 'Sagrada Familia' you suddenly look up and see this immense cathedral towering above your head. It's amazing to look at from the outside but when you enter inside the building, wow, your breath is taken away by it's sheer beauty and spiritual abundance."
1,"late cancellation and no help in trying to rebook another tour, terrible service",we travelled from NZ for 30 hours to go on a cruise with one of the main reasons of picking the cruise was to enable me to see the Basilica but the day before our tour we were told it was cancelled. we rang to see if there was any other option but were told no. Tried to arrange another tour but due to the late notification was unable. I was devastated and unable to enjoy Barcelona and returned to the ship early.
2,A MUST for first time visitors to Barcelona!,"What a spectacular landmark for the city. Stunning architecture with ethereal interior spaces, which is such a contrast in extremes. The scale is truly remarkable and cannot really be appreciated until you are standing inside the massive structure. Take your time and wonder in all the little spaces. Online ticket ordering and audio tour was easy to order and navigate on site."
3,Cool to see. Way too crowded,"It’s very cool to see it. I didn’t go inside and don’t feel like I missed out at all but oh my god the sheer amount of people surrounding the cathedral was insane. I could see everyone inside the gates who had tickets and it looked like chaos, no organisation and I have no idea how they would safely evacuate everyone if needed. Literally thousands of people. I would suggest viewing the cathedral from across the street at the park as it’s less crowded and you get good pictures. Very cool seeing it though"
4,Marvel or monstrous,"Whether you love it, or it gives you nightmares…the century of work should be seen. Long lines to go inside, but studying the outside can take a long time."
5,"So much to take in, such beauty","Dear readers, I was torn between using a guide vs the free audio guide app. I’m glad we stuck with just the app, it is extremely detailed, and you can go at your own pace…once again seeing Gaudi’s vision come alive is magnificent in the design of this church…the details are beyond belief…the colors, the sculptures, and design, are something that can’t be soaked in from just one visit. It’s a piece of art, where you see new things from different angles. We did not get to go up the tower, they were sold out, but honestly the line was long even with a reservation. Make sure to get your tickets ahead…what I loved most, is it is so inviting no matter what your religious beliefs are."
6,Breathtaking building but save money on guided tour,"To see the Sagrada Familia is an amazing privilege. The kaleidoscope of colors is explosive and breathtaking. This is a must stop if you are visiting Barcelona. I also recommend touring the museum in the basement and taking about 10 minutes to watch the excellent historical film in the museum's theater. It plays on a constant loop and provides a cool, dark break for weary tourists.

But I really can't recommend purchasing tickets for a live guided tour. The audio equipment that is used is pretty poor quality and it is hard to hear the guide. These guides work very hard and they present the material over and over again, so this is no commentary on their energy or presentation. But if you can't hear what's going on, it's useless. I got a lot more out of the museum and the film than the guided tour."
7,My favorite cathedral visit ever - because of the audio guide,"Absolutely stunning building and history. The audio tour guide on the phone was the best I've ever heard. Easy to understand, insightful, detailed.

Pro tip - remember to bring your earbuds!"
8,Gaudi all the way,Exceptional Too good The scale is phenomenal The number of people visiting is enormous Worth the effort Security takes long
9,Interesting architecture,"As you can imagine, the big draw & interest in this building is the architecture.

This is a great place to try & take some photos. But don’t think your going to set up any kind of tripod for your camera or phone inside the building because they won’t let you. So if your trying to get everyone in the family photo, you will have to find another way.

The park across the street is one of the best places to get most of the building in the pictures you take. There are a few other places around the building across the street as well. Just be patient because the large crowds that visit are all trying to do the same thing.

Paying to go up the tower really wasn’t worth it in my opinion. But that is strictly just my opinion."
10,Get a guide with skip the line passes!,It's a must see in Barcelona. My tip is to get a guide with skip the line passes. We had a guide and she timed everything perfectly. We waited about 5 minutes in line and to go through security took another 5 minutes. There were lines and lines of people waiting to get in. There is no shade so the wait will be very hot. If you only see the outside you will be missing a lot.
11,Surreal Church,"This is an absolute must go-to in Barcelona. It is unlike any other church i've ever been to, and a great characterization of Gaudi."
12,Sagrada Familia was fantastic,The architectural design of the Sagrada cannot be understated. It is a fantastic building and well worth the visit.
13,Sagrada Familia,Do yourself a favor and use the audio guided tours. So many interesting facts one would not have known otherwise. A Must see while in Barcelona. Keep in mind it is always crowded so be patient.
14,Must see,"Another must see in barcelona. Spectacular construction. The size is astonishing, the detail of the work etc."
15,"Beautiful, not finished :)","The Basilica is incredible! You cannot believe the architectural detail until you get up close. While we did not tour inside, we visited here twice. Very easy to access via Metro."
16,Bad experience,"Beautiful, but unhelpful staff. Very expensive and with tickets at first they said that we couldn't go in. Having tickets and spending more than 400 euros for it. They said that was full."
17,Explosion of colours!,"You have to see it. There are no words to describe the Sagrada Familia. Gaudi was ahead of his tim, what a genius!"
18,This is an amazing work of art and functioning cathedral.,"Gaudi had amazing, and very ambitious ideas - and making this with all natural light And displaying the seasons… it’s incredible. Very crowded but with the group we got right in. Did not do towers but if you do they say you take elevators up and stairs down. The audio was okay, our leader was very informative but the radios cut out some. Definitely a highlight and a must see"
19,An experience you will remember!,"Many of us travel Europe to see the interesting architecture from centuries past. This quest usually includes specific stops at Cathedrals and Basilicas, many surviving from the Middle Ages. If you are part of this group, you should add to your bucket list, a visit to Barcelona and the magnificent Sagrada Familia. Designed by Gaudi over a century ago, it is the most modern religious structure to be found in Europe. Don't just accept a view of the exterior; you must go inside. Like the Grand Canyon, it cannot be really experienced without a trip to the interior. We used a tour by the name of Cool Tours Barcelona, which provided time stamped passes which avoid standing in long lines.
Don't miss this one!"
20,"Such an amazing site, Gaudi was purely genius.","Our guide was very knowledgeable, explained so much of the architecture and symbolism. The external was beautiful, the internal was something we had never experienced."
21,Do not miss out on visiting,A great landmark of Barcelona and a must see. The Basilica was designed by the great Gaudi and is a great and majestic monument in every aspect.
22,Amazing,"Amazing!
Breathtaking!!!!!!
This is the place which is must see in Barcelona!

If you are architectural lover, I suggested you to go inside :)

23,A Sunday to Remember,"If you have the opportunity to be there on a Sunday morning, the 9:00 am international worship service is quite the experience. You should be in line no later than 7:30 am to get in. There is no charge and you will have to leave as soon as the service is over, but you will be overwhelmed by the beauty and the music."
24,A must see,"Absolutely the place to see when in Barcelona,however you really don’t need to spend the extra money for a guided tour if you can avoid it. The magic is outside the Basilica,not so much inside. We did the Tour of passion, a heck of a view from the top which you reach by elevator but then you have over 400 steps in a spiral staircase to come down which can make you dizzy."
25,An unforgettable experience,"The Sagrada Familia is breathtakingly beautiful and we thoroughly enjoyed our visit. Our guided tour was at 9:30 am and we had to be at the location a 1/2 hour before. As the place opens at 9:00 am, we had plenty of time to go in and look around before our guided tour started. Our guide, Macarena, was excellent and we enjoyed the whole experience. I highly recommend visiting this amazing place."
26,Magnificent!,"The Basilica is magnificent and majestic! This towering structure had us in awe from Mount Monjuic, 7km away, where it could be seen in the distance. Arriving at the Basilca however left us in awe.
We had a skip the line ticket and getting in was a breeze. We also used the audio guide that worked perfectly."
27,Exceeded High Expectations,"Lived up to high expectations!! The outside structure with all kinds of shapes and designs is definitely eye catching, The interior is where the Gaudi magic is. Unbelievable use of natural light!! Can see why this is one of the most visited churches in the world.
We visited with a group so our timed entry was fast and easy. Suggest you purchase advance tickets because there was already a line at 10 a.m."
28,Surely the best way to visit,Beautiful building and excellent guide. All very straight forward regarding meeting and entry. Our guide was very informative and interesting. There are definitely things I learned which I wouldn't have found out any other way. I have forgotten his name - but he was Spanish with. Danish father! Thank you for your good humour and clarity. Well worth the money.
29,Well worth the visit…,"The most visited tourist attraction in the world and the most reviewed place on TA. This pretty much says it all. We had a 9:15am entry and a 9:30am tour of the Passion Tower. Entry to both was relatively quick, so the time must have been good. Later the queues had started to build. My only piece of advice is if you do either the Nativity or Passion Towers, it’s 400 steps down. I play golf (walking) 3 times a week and my legs were wobbly by the time we reached the ground floor."
30,Breathtaking Basilica,"A visit to this fabulous basilica was the highlight of our trip to Barcelona. It is breathtaking from the moment you see it and even more so when you go inside.

We did a guided tour with a very knowledgeable guide. We also bought tickets to take the elevator to the top with a walk back down. Not sure what that is called but it was very worthwhile, albeit a little daunting as it is narrow with a lot of steps. Our tickets had a time indicated on them, but we were able to go without waiting for the time on our tickets.

It was March but was very busy. I can only imagine that summer is much worse. I highly recommend buying your tickets online before going. We were told it can sell out so be aware of that. It was a little confusing trying to find the meeting place for the guide, but we were able to figure it out as we got there early with time to spare. With bigger crowds it could be a little nerve wracking. Just standing there looking at all the stone carvings was well worth it. the outside is spectacuar."
31,Holy Family / Sagrada Familia,"I enjoyed this tour in the biggest church of the World.
Our tour guide Raul was so funny and knowledgeable about the history of the construction of this building, its architect, and the Bible. We learned, we enjoyed, and we left with a piece of history of one of Barcelona most cherished item. Gracias Raul!"
32,Tour,I can say that this experience has been somewhat of an eye opening experience. Gaudi’s passion was on display and didn’t disappoint. The interior and exterior were breathtaking. Was not on my bucket list but it should have been! Awesome experience.
33,Amazing Architecture Must see attraction while in Barcelona. Recommended advance purchase admission tickets online to skip the,Amazing Architecture of Sagrada Familia. Crowded with locals and tourists. Long lines for tickets but worth a visit and value added.
34,Breath-taking,"Even if you are not religious it is definitely worth a visit, the basilica is stunning inside and out. We also took a trip up to the top of the Passion Tower which allowed us to see some of the Gaudi mosaic up close - although the 400+ steps down were a challenge! Thank goodness there was a lift to take us to the top! The inside with the stain glass windows was breath-taking. We chose to visit with a Basilica tour guide who was able to explain and point out features we would have otherwise missed. Entry can take a while as there is security and bag checks to pass so I would recommend arriving at least 30 minutes before any tour time."
35,A Highlight Of Our Visit,"Quite literally will take your breath away. We went on the 430 tour which was very informative and made many aspects of the history and architecture come alive to us. The afternoon visit also timed well with the setting sun to create a wonderful display of colors from the stained glass windows. We had tickets for the towers but ended up not using them after seeing a few videos and speaking to some other visitors as the views are not all that good due to the ongoing construction and it does get crowded up there with a long walk down. A highlight of our trip and truly a work of genius as well. Do not miss this , its well worth your time."
36,Don’t Miss This and Definitely Book a Guided Tour,"There are so many reviews on this, I’m going to keep mine brief.
Simply do not visit Barcelona and miss this. It was our highlight and just completely stunning.
Definitely definitely book a guided tour. Our guide was Helena and she was incredibly knowledgeable about the history of this magnificent place and the detailed design of the facades. You pick so much more information than if you did it yourself."
37,"Amazing church, largest unfinished church in the world","Truly the most amazing church I have ever been to. The moment I first turned around after leaving the tube station I was struck by the sheer size of the towers and complexity of the architecture. It was unbelievable to see such a huge building in Barcelona and it looks better than any photo I previously saw. Going in there were beautiful coloured church windows where the sunlight streamed through and large columns holding up the roof, reminiscent of a ""forest"". Since the church is unfinished, it was nice to understand the history behind it as I listened to the audio commentary and looked at a few screens displaying documentaries. the tour up the Nativity towers was rather short and the construction affected the view but it was nice to see some structures up close. I would love to come back again when the church is finished. I spent some time in worship and there was a central section for people to sit and take part in worship."
38,No Real Words,"You LITERALLY cannot put this place into words....nor will your pictures do it ANY justice !!!!!! It is absolutely incredible. Without a doubt an absolute MUST SEE for any trip to Barcelona. The incredible detail that Gaudi put in is truly astonishing. Especially when you consider the era that it was built and the fact that it is still under construction.

There are some nice gift shops (all selling the same things) and restaurants around the immediate area.

There is a pretty heavy security and screening process as you go in....so just be aware. However, they were pretty quick and efficient, though I image it could be a little different during high tourist season

You cannot go to Barcelona and not go into this place !!!!"
39,Brilliant,"The building was fantastic, I used on the mobile tour guide which was great although some of the directions I happened to get lost with but nevertheless thoroughly enjoyed experiencing the nature and culture."
